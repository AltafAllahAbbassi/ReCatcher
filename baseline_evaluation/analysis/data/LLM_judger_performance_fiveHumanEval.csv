    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

check(largest_smallest_integers)",SOLUTION_TWO,"Solution Two is more efficient because it uses the built-in max() and min() functions after collecting negative and positive integers in separate lists. This reduces the number of comparisons needed to find the largest negative and smallest positive integers, as it only traverses the list once to categorize the numbers and then performs constant time operations to find the max and min. In contrast, Solution One performs multiple comparisons within the same loop, which can lead to increased time complexity.",SOLUTION_TWO,"Solution Two uses additional memory to store the lists of negative and positive integers, which could be seen as a drawback. However, this trade-off is justified by the improved time complexity. Solution One, on the other hand, maintains only a few variables, which may seem more memory efficient but results in a more complex and slower algorithm overall. Therefore, while Solution Two uses more memory, it ultimately provides better performance."
