    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

This allows it to traverse the list only once to collect the integers, and then it computes the max and min in constant time for the smaller lists. In contrast, Solution One checks each integer multiple times, leading to a higher time complexity overall.",SOLUTION_TWO,"Solution Two uses additional memory to store the negative and positive integers in separate lists, which can be significant if the input list is large. However, this is a trade-off for improved time performance. Solution One, while using less memory by not storing intermediate results, has a more complex logic that could lead to inefficiencies in larger datasets. Therefore, Solution Two is better in terms of overall performance despite its higher memory usage."
