exp_0_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'has_close_elements' has a logical error in the nested loop. The inner loop should iterate from 'i + 1' to 'len(numbers)', but it currently checks all indices from 'i + 1' to 'len(numbers) - 1'. This means that the last element is not being compared with the current element 'i', which can lead to missing pairs that are closer than the threshold. For example, in the test case 'has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3)', the function may return incorrect results due to this oversight."
exp_0_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'separate_paren_groups' is not implemented, as indicated by the 'TODO' comment. Therefore, it cannot correctly separate groups of nested parentheses as described in the function's docstring. Without a proper implementation, it will not pass the provided test assertions."
exp_0_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,CORRECT,"The function 'truncate_number' correctly calculates the decimal part of a positive floating point number by subtracting the largest integer smaller than the number (using 'math.floor') from the number itself. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct decimal parts for the given inputs."
exp_0_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly implements the logic to track the balance of a bank account starting from zero. It iterates through the list of operations, updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns True, which matches the requirements stated in the function's docstring. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness, as all assertions pass without errors."
exp_0_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is incorrect because it uses 'mean(numbers)' without importing or defining the 'mean' function. Additionally, the test assertions are not correctly validating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for the provided datasets. The expected results in the assertions do not match the correct MAD calculations. For example, the MAD for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3, but the assertion checks for a different value. The function needs to be corrected to properly calculate the mean and then compute the MAD based on that mean."
exp_0_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly handle the case where the input list has more than one element. Specifically, it adds a delimiter after the first element but does not correctly intersperse it between all elements. For example, the call intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2) should return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation will not produce this result. The recursive call does not properly concatenate the delimiter between all elements."
exp_0_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. The use of 'max(len(re.findall(r'\(', x))' only counts the number of opening parentheses in each group, rather than determining the maximum depth of nesting. For example, for the input '(()())', it would return 2, which is correct, but for '((()))', it would also return 2 instead of 3. The correct approach would involve tracking the current depth while iterating through the characters of each group and updating the maximum depth accordingly."
exp_0_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_substring is intended to filter strings that contain the specified substring. However, the test case 'check(candidate)' includes an assertion that expects 'grunt' and 'prune' to be returned when filtering with the substring 'run'. Neither 'grunt' nor 'prune' contains the substring 'run', which makes this assertion incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The use of 'reduce' from the 'functools' module is missing an import statement, and it will raise a NameError. Additionally, the product of an empty list should return 1, but the current implementation will return 0 if the list is empty, which is incorrect. The test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)' is also misleading, as the product of 100 and 0 should be 0, which is correctly handled, but the overall logic is flawed."
exp_0_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It iterates through the list and appends the maximum value found from the start of the list up to the current index. The provided test cases in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected, returning the correct rolling maximum for various input scenarios."
exp_0_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is incorrectly implemented. The test assertions provided in the 'check' function are meant for the 'is_palindrome' function, not for 'make_palindrome'. Additionally, the logic in 'make_palindrome' does not correctly construct the shortest palindrome for all cases. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate('jerry') == 'jerryrrej'' is incorrect; the expected output should be 'jerryj' instead. The function fails to handle cases where the input string is not a palindrome correctly."
exp_0_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. The test case candidate('111000', '101010') fails because the function will only iterate over the length of the shorter string, resulting in an incorrect output. The expected output for this case should be '010010', but the function will only process the first three characters of each string, leading to an incorrect result."
exp_0_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'longest' is supposed to return the first longest string in case of ties, but it uses the 'max' function which returns the last longest string instead. For example, in the test case 'check(candidate(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])', the expected output is 'zzzz', but if there were another string of the same length as 'zzzz' before it, 'max' would return that one instead of 'zzzz'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirement of returning the first longest string in case of ties."
exp_0_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they cover various scenarios and return the expected results. The function handles both cases of coprime numbers and numbers with common factors accurately."
exp_0_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,True,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates a list of all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 1 to the length of the string plus one, slicing the string appropriately to obtain each prefix. The provided test assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various input cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_0_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The function string_sequence is supposed to return a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n inclusive. However, the implementation uses ''.join() without a space delimiter, which results in the numbers being concatenated without spaces. For example, string_sequence(5) would return '012345' instead of '0 1 2 3 4 5'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly counts distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The implementation uses a set to store unique characters after converting the string to lowercase, which aligns with the function's description. The provided test assertions validate various cases, including empty strings, strings with all distinct characters, and strings with repeated characters, all of which return the expected results."
exp_0_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical note legend. Instead of returning a list of integers based on the input string, it returns a hardcoded list. The function fails to account for the different note representations ('o', 'o|', and '.|') and their corresponding beat values. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will not pass, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring. The current approach calculates the difference in length between the original string and the string after removing all occurrences of the substring. This method fails to account for overlapping cases, such as in the example of 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', where the expected count is 3 (the overlaps 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the implementation would return 2. A correct implementation would involve iterating through the string and checking for the substring at each index, allowing for overlaps."
exp_0_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sorting is done lexicographically (alphabetically) rather than numerically. For example, 'three five nine' should return 'three five nine' as it is already sorted, but the expected output should be 'five three nine' if sorted numerically. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which causes the output to be concatenated without spaces. The correct implementation should map the words to their corresponding numeric values, sort those values, and then convert them back to words before returning."
exp_0_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly return the closest elements in all cases. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the closest elements are 2.2 and 2.0, which have a difference of 0.2, while 3.9 and 4.0 have a difference of 0.1. The function should return (2.0, 2.2) instead of (3.9, 4.0). This indicates that the logic for finding the closest elements is flawed."
exp_0_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'rescale_to_unit' does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum values are the same, which would lead to a division by zero in the expression '(max_val - min_val)'. This situation can occur if the input list contains identical elements. The test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is also incorrect because it expects the output to be in the range [0.0, 1.0] but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] instead, which is not a valid rescaling. Therefore, the implementation is not correct."
exp_0_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various input cases, including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass, indicating that the function works correctly."
exp_0_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strlen' correctly returns the length of the given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function also validate the correctness of the implementation by testing various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_0_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' is intended to find the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n' itself. However, the implementation starts the loop from 'n' and checks for divisibility, returning 'n' if it is divisible by itself, which is not the desired behavior. The correct implementation should start from 'n-1' and check downwards to find the largest divisor smaller than 'n'. For example, calling 'largest_divisor(3)' should return 1, but the current implementation would incorrectly return 3."
exp_0_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'factorize' function does not correctly factorize the input integer. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect results as it does not properly handle cases where a factor is repeated. For example, when testing with 70, the expected output is [2, 5, 7], but the function may not return this correctly due to the way it reduces n. Additionally, the function does not check for factors beyond the square root of n, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results for larger numbers. The test cases provided in the 'check' function may pass for some inputs but fail for others, indicating that the implementation is not robust."
exp_0_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'remove_duplicates' is not implemented, which means it does not perform any operations to remove duplicates from the input list. The provided test cases will fail because the function will return None instead of the expected output. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'swapcase()' is appropriate for this task, and the test assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, including an empty string and strings with punctuation."
exp_0_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The function 'concatenate' correctly implements the logic to join a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the expected behavior of 'concatenate' for both an empty list and a list with multiple strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings that start with the specified prefix. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']' is incorrect because the expected output should include all occurrences of strings that start with 'xxx', which are 'xxx', 'xxxAAA', and 'xxx'. The correct expected output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] but the assertion fails because it does not account for multiple occurrences of 'xxx'. Therefore, the test case does not validate the function correctly."
exp_0_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is intended to return only positive numbers from the input list. However, the test assertions in the check function reveal that the expected output for the second test case is incorrect. The expected output should not include the zero (0) as it is not a positive number. The correct output for the second test case should be [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1], which matches the implementation. However, the first test case in the check function is incorrectly asserting that the output should include zero, which is not a positive number. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases are not accurately reflecting the requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for primality. The loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. It should only check up to the square root of n for factors. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for even numbers greater than 2 correctly, as it will incorrectly return True for even numbers other than 2. This can lead to incorrect results for larger numbers."
exp_0_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect because it does not properly handle the polynomial evaluation and root-finding process. Specifically, the function uses the 'poly' function incorrectly in the Newton-Raphson method. The formula for updating 'x' should involve the derivative of the polynomial, but the current implementation does not compute the derivative correctly. Additionally, the polynomial evaluation in 'poly' is incorrectly described in the comment; it should use 'xs[i] * x^i' instead of 'xs[1] * x^2' for the second term. This leads to incorrect results when finding roots, as the polynomial may not converge to the correct zero point."
exp_0_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it sorts the sublist of three elements starting from that index. This leads to incorrect results as seen in the test cases. For example, in the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the function will not produce this output because it sorts the first three elements [5, 6, 3] instead of just placing the sorted values at the correct indices."
exp_0_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to remove duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the resulting unique elements. The provided test assertion checks the function with a specific input and verifies that the output matches the expected result, which it does."
exp_0_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct, as it uses the built-in 'max' function to return the maximum element in the list. However, the test case in the 'check' function contains an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum element in that list is actually 124, not 123 as stated in the original docstring. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed."
exp_0_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the count of '7's in the string representation of the number is greater than 0, which means it increments the count for each number containing at least one '7'. The expected behavior is to count the total occurrences of the digit '7', not just whether it appears at least once. For example, the number 77 should contribute 2 to the count, but the current implementation would only count it as 1. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for the test cases provided."
exp_0_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the even indexed elements while preserving the odd indexed elements. The function collects even numbers and odd numbers separately, sorts the even numbers in descending order, and then appends the odd numbers to the end of the list. This approach does not maintain the original positions of the odd indexed elements in the output list. For example, in the test case 'sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])', the expected output is '[3, 6, 5, 4]', but the function would return '[6, 5, 3, 4]', which is incorrect. The function needs to sort only the elements at even indices and place them back in their respective positions in the final list."
exp_0_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic' correctly decodes the string encoded by 'encode_cyclic'. Additionally, the 'decode_cyclic' function is implemented correctly to reverse the encoding process, but it is not being tested. Therefore, the evaluation of correctness is based on the fact that the test is not appropriately validating the decoding function."
exp_0_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation only correctly handles the first two cases (n = 1 and n = 2) by returning 2 and 3, respectively. For n >= 3, it calls a function 'fibonacci(n)', which is not defined in the provided code. This will result in a NameError when n is greater than 2. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime; the function should instead generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is incomplete and always returns False, which does not fulfill the requirement of checking for three distinct elements that sum to zero. The provided test cases include scenarios where the function should return True, but due to the lack of implementation, it fails to do so. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified functionality."
exp_0_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it only contains a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any calculations or return any values. The test assertions expect the function to return the number of collisions, which is calculated as n * n (since each car moving left to right can collide with each car moving right to left). Without an implementation, the function cannot pass the tests."
exp_0_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is implemented correctly and returns the expected output for the provided test cases. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an incorrect expected output for the input [3, 2, 1]. The expected output should be [4, 3, 2] but the function actually returns [4, 3, 2], which is correct. The assertion for the input [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is also incorrect as the expected output is [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124] but the correct output should be [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]. Therefore, the overall evaluation is incorrect due to the faulty assertions."
exp_0_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is not implemented, which means it does not contain any logic to check for pairs of integers that sum to zero. As a result, it cannot return the expected outputs for the provided test cases, leading to failures in the assertions. The function must be implemented correctly to evaluate pairs of distinct integers in the list."
exp_0_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'change_base' is incorrect because it does not handle the conversion of numbers correctly for all bases. Specifically, the test case 'change_base(9, 3)' is expected to return '100', but the function will raise an error because the expected output for 9 in base 3 is actually '1000'. Additionally, the test case 'change_base(234, 2)' is expected to return '11101010', which is correct, but the function does not validate the output for all bases correctly. The assertion 'assert candidate(x, x + 1) == str(x)' is also problematic because it assumes that the output will match the string representation of the input number, which is not the case for bases greater than 10. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/45,HumanEval/45,True,CORRECT,"The function 'triangle_area' correctly implements the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base * height) / 2. The provided test assertions confirm that the function returns the expected results for the given inputs, including the example in the docstring. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the implementation is functioning as intended."
exp_0_HumanEval/46,HumanEval/46,False,INCORRECT,"The provided code does not implement the fib4 function, which is supposed to compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence without using recursion. The test assertions provided in the check function indicate expected outputs for specific inputs, but since the fib4 function is not implemented, it cannot produce any output. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is incorrect because the expected output for the second test case in the check function is wrong. The median of the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] should be 10.0, not 8.0. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, which could lead to an error. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements as specified in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/48,HumanEval/48,True,CORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse.

Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_0_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp is intended to return 2^n modulo p. The provided test cases include assertions that are not satisfied by the implementation. Specifically, the assertions check for modp(30, 5) and modp(31, 5), which are not part of the original function's docstring examples. The expected results for these cases are incorrect based on the mathematical calculations of 2^30 % 5 and 2^31 % 5. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all test cases, indicating that it is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The encode_shift function is designed to shift characters by 5 positions in the alphabet, but it does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet ('a' to 'z'). Additionally, the decode_shift function is supposed to reverse the encoding, but it also does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet. The test assertions in the check function are incorrectly checking the encode_shift function instead of the decode_shift function, which should be tested to ensure it correctly decodes the output of encode_shift. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is not correctly handling uppercase vowels. The vowels string only contains lowercase vowels ('aeiou'), so uppercase vowels ('AEIOU') are not being removed from the input text.

exp_0_HumanEval/52,HumanEval/52,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'below_threshold' is intended to return True if all numbers in the list are below the threshold 't'. However, the implementation checks if any number is greater than 't' and returns False immediately if it finds one. This is correct. However, the test cases include assertions that are not valid based on the function's description. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([1, 20, 4, 10], 21)' is expected to return True, which is correct, but the assertion 'assert not candidate([1, 8, 4, 10], 10)' is incorrect because 10 is not below 10, so it should return False, which is correctly asserted. The function works as intended, but the test cases have inconsistencies regarding the expected outcomes."

exp_0_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, but it only checks if they have the same characters in the same frequency. The test cases provided in the docstring and the assertions in the 'check' function imply that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True because they both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', but the current implementation would return False due to differing frequencies. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described."

exp_0_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function is incorrect. The derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients should be calculated by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and reducing the power by one. The current implementation incorrectly uses 'len(xs) - i' which does not accurately represent the power of x for each coefficient. For example, the derivative of the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] should yield [1, 4, 12, 20], which is correct, but the implementation fails for other cases like [3, 2, 1, 0, 4] where it returns [2, 2, 0, 16] instead of the correct [2, 2, 0, 0]. Additionally, the case for a single coefficient [1] should return an empty list, which is correctly handled. However, the overall logic for calculating the derivative is flawed."

It handles the base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2 correctly, returning 0, 0, and 1 respectively. The recursive case correctly computes the n-th FibFib number by summing the results of the three preceding numbers in the sequence. The test assertions provided in the check function confirm that the implementation produces the expected results for various inputs, including those not explicitly mentioned in the docstring. Therefore, the implementation is both correct and efficient given the nature of the problem."
exp_0_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' does not correctly handle uppercase vowels and the condition for 'y' being a vowel only at the end of the word. For example, the input 'Alone' should return 3, but the function does not account for uppercase vowels. Additionally, the function counts 'y' as a vowel regardless of its position in the word, which contradicts the requirement that 'y' is only a vowel when it is at the end of the word. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'circular_shift' does not handle the case where the shift value is greater than the number of digits correctly. According to the function's description, if 'shift' is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is '001', but the actual output is '00' (the first two digits are shifted out and not included in the result). Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' fails because the shift is greater than the number of digits, and the expected output should be '79', but the function does not handle this correctly. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

exp_0_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'fruit_distribution' is designed to calculate the number of mangoes in a basket based on the number of apples and oranges provided in a string and the total number of fruits. However, the implementation incorrectly assumes that the string format will always be consistent (i.e., 'X apples and Y oranges'). If the string format varies or if there are more than two types of fruits, the function will fail. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion that expects the output to be 10 for the input '5 apples and 6 oranges' with a total of 21 fruits, which is incorrect based on the logic of the function (it should return 10). Therefore, the implementation does not handle all cases correctly."

exp_0_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly sort the list in the specified 'strange order'. The current implementation simply returns the first element followed by a recursive call on the rest of the list, which does not adhere to the requirement of alternating between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4] should yield [1, 4, 2, 3], but the current implementation does not produce this result. The function needs to be restructured to correctly alternate between the minimum and maximum values from the list."
exp_0_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (a * b * c) / (4 * (a + b + c)), does not yield the correct area for a triangle given its sides. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its sides a, b, and c is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the test case assertions include incorrect expected values, such as triangle_area(1, 1, 1) which should return approximately 0.43 but actually returns 0.43 based on the incorrect formula. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_0_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly implements the requirements specified in the comments. It checks if the list is empty and returns False, which is appropriate. It verifies if the list is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If it is balanced, it then checks if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight 'w'. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, and all assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_0_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' is overly complex and does not correctly handle all cases for arrays of length greater than 5. The logic for determining the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is not generalized and relies on hardcoded conditions for specific lengths. For example, it fails to correctly compute the number of changes for arrays of length 6 or more. Additionally, the function does not utilize a systematic approach to compare elements from the start and end of the array, which is essential for determining palindromic properties. A more efficient and correct approach would involve iterating through the first half of the array and comparing it to the corresponding elements from the end, counting mismatches to determine the number of changes required."

According to the function's description, if both lists have the same total number of characters, it should return the first list. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' fails because the total character count of both lists is the same (8 characters each), but the function will return the second list instead of the first one. This indicates that the implementation does not correctly handle the equality case."
exp_0_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime does not correctly determine if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as a product of two prime factors, which is insufficient. For example, the assertion candidate(8) == True is incorrect because 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, which is not a product of three distinct prime numbers. Additionally, the function lacks a proper check for the count of prime factors, which is essential to meet the requirement of being the multiplication of exactly three primes."
exp_0_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' does not correctly determine if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. The condition 'x == n ** int(x / n)' is flawed because it does not accurately check if there exists an integer 'k' such that 'n**k = x'. Instead, it incorrectly calculates 'k' based on 'x' and 'n', which can lead to incorrect results. For example, 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' should return True, but the current implementation will not handle this correctly. Additionally, the function does not account for cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 1, which can lead to further incorrect evaluations."
exp_0_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'iscube' is intended to determine if a given integer is a perfect cube. However, the current implementation checks if the cube root of 'a' is an integer by comparing 'a**(1/3)' to 'int(a**(1/3))'. This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for large integers. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the test case checks for '1728', which is a perfect cube. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly since the cube root of a negative number is also negative, and the comparison will not yield the expected results. A more reliable approach would be to compute the cube root, round it to the nearest integer, and then cube that integer to see if it equals 'a'."
exp_0_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'hex_key' is supposed to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string. However, the prime digits in hexadecimal are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), and D (13). The function correctly checks for these digits, but the test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is incorrect because the input should be a string, not a list. An empty string should return 0, but passing an empty list will raise a TypeError. Therefore, the implementation does not handle the edge case correctly."

The condition 'if s[i:i+3] == s[i+1:i+4]' only checks if the first two characters of the 3-character substring are the same, which does not ensure that all three characters are distinct. For example, the input 'abc' would incorrectly return True, but it should return True because all characters are distinct. The correct approach would be to check if all three characters are different, which can be done by checking if the set of the substring has a length of 3."
exp_0_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values that are strictly less than the thresholds for letter grades. For example, the GPA of 3.0 should yield 'B+', but the implementation incorrectly assigns 'B+' to any GPA that is 3.0 or greater. The same issue occurs for other thresholds as well. The correct implementation should use '>' for all comparisons except for the highest grade (A+), which should be '>=', and the lowest grade (E), which should be '=='. This leads to incorrect letter grades being assigned for certain GPA values."
exp_0_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prime_length' contains a logical error in determining whether the length of the string is a prime number. Specifically, the function incorrectly returns True for strings of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the loop that checks for factors of the string length does not correctly handle the case where the length is 2, as it will return True for all lengths greater than 1 that are not divisible by any number from 2 to len(string)-1. This leads to incorrect results for strings of lengths that are not prime. For example, 'orange' has a length of 6, which is not prime, but the function would incorrectly return True for it. Therefore, the assertions in the test cases will fail for certain inputs."
exp_0_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' is inefficient and incorrect for counting n-digit integers that start or end with 1. The current implementation iterates through all n-digit integers, which is computationally expensive for larger n. Additionally, it does not account for the overlap of numbers that both start and end with 1, leading to potential overcounting. The correct approach should calculate the counts mathematically: for n-digit numbers, there are 10^(n-1) total numbers, and the counts of those starting with 1 and ending with 1 can be derived without iteration."
exp_0_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer N, but it instead returns the binary representation of N itself. For example, for N = 1000, the sum of digits is 1, but the function returns '1111101000', which is the binary representation of 1000. The test assertions expect the binary representation of the sum of the digits, not the number itself, leading to incorrect results."
exp_0_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is intended to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the implementation incorrectly sums the elements at even indices instead, as it uses 'range(0, len(lst), 2)', which starts from index 0 and increments by 2. This results in summing elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc., rather than the odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.). Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement as described in the docstring."
exp_0_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `anti_shuffle` does not correctly sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces. The current implementation uses `sorted(s.split())`, which sorts the list of words instead of sorting the characters within each word. As a result, the output does not match the expected behavior described in the comments. For example, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation does not achieve this."
exp_0_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'get_row' does not correctly handle the case where the integer 'x' appears multiple times in the same row. The method 'index()' returns the first occurrence of 'x', which means that if 'x' appears multiple times in a row, only the first occurrence's coordinates will be recorded. This leads to incorrect results for cases where 'x' appears more than once in the same row. For example, in the test case with the input 'get_row([[1, 2, 1, 4], [1, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], 1)', the expected output should include all occurrences of '1', but the current implementation will only capture the first occurrence in each row."
exp_0_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' is incorrect because it does not sort the array as specified in the function's description. The function is supposed to sort the array in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, and in descending order if the sum is even. However, the implementation only checks the length of the array and does not perform any sorting. For example, it returns the original array for lengths greater than 2 without sorting, which violates the requirement to return a sorted copy of the array. Additionally, the function does not handle arrays longer than 20 elements correctly, as it is incomplete and cuts off abruptly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encrypt' function is incorrect because it does not properly rotate the alphabet by two positions as described in the function's docstring. The code attempts to create a new alphabet by shifting the original alphabet, but it then unnecessarily duplicates and replaces characters in a way that does not yield the expected results. The test cases provided in the 'check' function will fail because the output of 'encrypt' does not match the expected encrypted strings. For example, 'hi' should return 'jk', not 'lm', and other test cases will also produce incorrect results."
exp_0_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is not unique. For example, in the test case next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected output is None since there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -35 as the second smallest, but the function will return -34 after sorting, which is incorrect. The implementation fails to check for duplicates properly."
exp_0_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' does not correctly count the number of sentences that start with the word 'I'. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the letter 'I' in the string, which does not take into account sentence delimiters or the position of 'I' at the beginning of sentences. For example, the input 'I love It !' incorrectly returns 1 instead of 1, but 'I feel good today. I will be productive. will kill It' incorrectly returns 2 instead of 1, as only the first sentence starts with 'I'. The function needs to split the input string into sentences and check the first word of each sentence."
exp_0_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' does not correctly check if all inputs are integers before evaluating the condition. The current implementation only checks if 'x' is equal to the sum of 'y' and 'z' and whether 'x' is an integer. It fails to check if 'y' and 'z' are also integers before returning True. This leads to incorrect results for cases where 'y' or 'z' are not integers, even if 'x' is equal to their sum. For example, 'any_int(3.0, 4, 7)' should return False, but it incorrectly returns True because '3.0' is treated as an integer.

exp_0_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly swap the case of letters or replace vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet. Specifically, it only converts the input message to lowercase and does not handle uppercase letters or the vowel replacement correctly. For example, the input 'TEST' should return 'tgst', but the current implementation would return 'tgs' instead. Additionally, the vowel replacement logic is flawed as it directly accesses the character two positions ahead without considering the vowel itself. The test cases provided in the 'check' function will fail due to these issues."

Instead, the function should check if all keys are either all upper case or all lower case. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the dictionary is empty correctly, as it should return False, which it does. However, the overall logic for checking the case of the keys is flawed."

Additionally, the function is hardcoded for specific values of n, making it inefficient and unable to handle larger inputs dynamically. The implementation fails to generate the correct list of primes for values greater than 23, as it is truncated at the end. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

However, the expected results in the test cases do not match the actual implementation. For example, multiply(19, 28) should return 72, but the unit digits are 9 and 8, which multiply to 72, so that part is correct. However, for multiply(148, 412), the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16, which is also correct. The issue arises with the test case multiply(14, -15) which should return 20, but the unit digits are 4 and 5, which multiply to 20, so that is also correct. The test case multiply(76, 67) should return 42, but the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42, so that is correct as well. The function is correct for the provided test cases, but the expected output for the test cases is not consistent with the function's purpose. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect based on the expected outputs in the test cases."

However, the test case count_upper('EEEE') is expected to return 2, but it actually returns 1 because the function only checks the characters at indices 0 and 2 (both 'E'), which are uppercase vowels. The implementation is correct in counting uppercase vowels at even indices, but the expected output for the test case is incorrect. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the code is incorrect due to the mismatch in expected results."
exp_0_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function closest_integer does not correctly handle the rounding away from zero for equidistant values.

The logic for determining the largest even number in the range is flawed, as it does not account for the scenario where x is less than y and both numbers are odd or even.

Additionally, the conversion of integers to their corresponding names is not done correctly, as the code attempts to convert all elements to strings multiple times without filtering them first. The correct approach should involve filtering the array for valid integers (1-9), sorting that filtered array, reversing it, and then mapping those integers to their string representations.

For example, for the input '1234567', the correct count of odd digits is 4 (1, 3, 5, 7), but the implementation incorrectly counts it as 4 by subtracting the count of '0's from the length of the string. This leads to incorrect outputs for the test cases provided."

For example, in the test case candidate([-1, -2, -3, 2, -10]), the correct minimum sub-array sum is -14, but the implementation would not capture this correctly due to the reset condition. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input array is empty correctly, as it returns 0 instead of raising an error or returning None, which is not specified in the function's description."

However, the test assertions include negative integers, which contradicts the function's description that specifies only non-negative integers should be sorted. Additionally, the expected outputs in the assertions do not match the expected behavior of the function based on its description. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([1,5,2,3,4]) == [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]' is incorrect as the expected output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The test cases provided will fail because the function does not adhere to the specified behavior of counting consonants."
exp_0_HumanEval/118,HumanEval/118,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function get_closest_vowel has several issues. Firstly, it converts the input word to lowercase, which causes it to lose case sensitivity as specified in the function description. This leads to incorrect results for words with uppercase vowels. For example, 'FULL' should return 'U', but it returns 'u' instead. Additionally, the logic for checking the closest vowel is flawed; it does not correctly identify vowels that are between two consonants. The function should iterate through the word and check for a vowel that is immediately preceded and followed by consonants, but it currently only checks the last vowel found. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Firstly, the date format is not consistently validated; it attempts to replace '-' with '/' but does not correctly handle the validation for the date format 'mm-dd-yyyy'. Additionally, the logic for checking the validity of days in each month is overly complicated and does not cover all edge cases, such as leap years for February. The function also does not properly handle cases where the month or day is not a two-digit number, which can lead to incorrect parsing. Furthermore, the function is incomplete and cuts off mid-logic, which would lead to runtime errors. Overall, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

This results in the function always splitting the input text by whitespace, regardless of whether there are commas or not. Additionally, the counting of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet is incorrectly implemented; it does not correctly count only those letters that are in odd positions. The test cases also reveal issues with the expected outputs, particularly with the handling of punctuation and whitespace."

Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1]) == -10' is incorrect; the expected output should be 10 instead of -10, as there are 6 positive numbers and 1 negative number, leading to a product of -1 and a sum of magnitudes of 10."

Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions do not match the expected values based on the provided recurrence relations. For example, the expected output for 'tri(3)' should be [1, 3, 2, 8], but the function does not compute the correct values for higher 'n'. The function also returns float values (e.g., 2.0, 3.0) instead of integers, which is inconsistent with the expected output format."

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where all digits are even correctly, as it will attempt to multiply an empty list, resulting in an error. The correct approach would involve converting each character back to an integer before checking if it is odd and handling the case where no odd digits are found."

For example, 'apple pi e' should return True, but the current implementation would return True only if the last character is an alphabetic character and the second last character is not a space. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or consists solely of spaces correctly, leading to potential index errors. The test cases also include assertions that would fail based on the current implementation."

For example, in the test case 'largest_smallest_integers([-1, -3, -5, -6])', the expected output is (-1, None), but the function would return (-1, None) correctly. However, in the case of 'largest_smallest_integers([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, -2])', it returns (-2, 1) which is incorrect because it should return (-2, 1) as the smallest positive integer.

exp_1_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function has_close_elements is incorrect because it does not correctly check all pairs of numbers in the list. The inner loop should iterate from i + 1 to len(numbers) - 1, but it currently iterates to len(numbers), which causes it to check the same element against itself in the last iteration. This results in incorrect behavior for certain test cases, such as when the last element is compared with itself. The test cases provided in the check function reveal this flaw, as the expected results do not match the actual outputs for some assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'separate_paren_groups' is currently not implemented and returns an empty list. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of separating groups of nested parentheses from the input string. The provided test assertions expect specific outputs based on the input strings, but since the function does not process the input at all, it will always fail these assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,CORRECT,"The function 'truncate_number' correctly computes the decimal part of a positive floating point number by subtracting the integer part (obtained using 'math.floor') from the original number. The provided test cases validate the function's correctness, as it returns the expected decimal parts for the given inputs."
exp_1_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,True,CORRECT,"The function 'below_zero' correctly implements the logic to track the balance of a bank account starting from zero. It iterates through the list of operations, updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance goes below zero, it returns True, which is consistent with the function's description. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate various scenarios, including edge cases, and all assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_1_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is incorrect because it uses the 'mean' function without importing it or defining it. Additionally, the calculation of the mean absolute deviation is not correctly computed as the mean of the absolute differences from the mean. The test assertions also suggest that the expected results are incorrect, as the mean absolute deviation for the provided datasets does not match the expected values in the assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function is incorrect because it does not properly handle the insertion of the delimiter between all elements of the list. The recursive call to 'intersperse' only adds the delimiter after the first element and does not continue to add it between all subsequent elements. For example, the input [2, 2, 2] with a delimiter of 2 should return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation would not produce this result correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group. The use of 'max(len(re.findall(r'\(', x)) - len(re.findall(r'\)', x))' will not yield the correct maximum depth for each group of parentheses. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses, which does not represent the depth of nesting. The correct approach would involve iterating through each character in the string and maintaining a counter for the current depth, updating the maximum depth encountered for each group."
exp_1_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_substring' is incorrect because it does not account for the case sensitivity of the substring search. The test case 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' fails because 'run' is not found in 'trumpet' or 'gruesome' when considering case sensitivity. To fix this, the comparison should be done in a case-insensitive manner, for example by converting both the string and the substring to lowercase before checking for inclusion."
exp_1_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' does not handle the case of an empty list correctly when calculating the product. The use of 'reduce' with an initial value of 1 is correct for the product, but when the list is empty, 'reduce' will not be called, and thus it will return 1 as expected. However, the product of an empty list should be defined as 1, which is correctly handled. The issue arises in the test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)', where the expected product should be 0, but the implementation will return 0 as the product of the list [100, 0] is indeed 0. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect for the assertion checks, particularly for the case where the list contains a zero."
exp_1_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'rolling_max' function does not correctly compute the rolling maximum for the given list of integers. The expected output for the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2] is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], but the function returns [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4] which is correct. However, the test case 'assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4]' is incorrect because the rolling maximum should be [1, 2, 3, 4] which is correct. The function fails to handle cases where the maximum should not change when the current number is less than the last maximum. The test case 'assert candidate([4, 3, 2, 1]) == [4, 4, 4, 4]' is also correct. The function does not account for the fact that the maximum should remain the same until a larger number is encountered. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_1_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is not being tested in the 'check' function; instead, 'is_palindrome' is being tested. The implementation of 'make_palindrome' is also incorrect because it does not correctly append the necessary characters to form the shortest palindrome. For example, 'jerry' should return 'jerryyj', but it returns 'jerryrrej'. The logic for finding the longest palindromic prefix and appending the reverse of the remaining string is flawed."
exp_1_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. In the test case candidate('111000', '101010'), the function will only compare the characters at the same indices, resulting in an incorrect output. For example, the last two characters of '111000' will not be processed, leading to a mismatch in the expected output. The function should either pad the shorter string or handle the length difference appropriately to ensure correct XOR results."
exp_1_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the 'max' function will return the last occurrence of the longest string in the list, which violates this requirement. For example, calling 'longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc', 'dd'])' would return 'ccc', which is correct, but calling 'longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc', 'dd', 'ee'])' would return 'ee' instead of 'ccc', which is incorrect. The test cases also do not cover this scenario, leading to potential unnoticed errors."
exp_1_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function cover various scenarios, including coprime numbers (3, 7), a pair with a common divisor (10, 15), and cases with larger numbers (49, 14 and 144, 60). All assertions in the check function pass, confirming that the implementation is functioning as expected."
exp_1_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,INCORRECT,"The function all_prefixes is expected to return a list of prefixes from shortest to longest. However, the implementation includes an empty string as the first element in the list, which is not consistent with the expected output. The correct output for an empty string should be an empty list, and for non-empty strings, it should start from the first character. The test case for an empty string is correct, but the implementation does not handle the prefix generation correctly as it includes an empty string prefix."
exp_1_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The correct implementation should return a string with space-delimited numbers, but the current implementation returns a concatenated string without spaces. For example, calling string_sequence(5) should return '0 1 2 3 4 5', but it currently returns '012345'. This discrepancy leads to the failure of the test assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters correctly counts the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The implementation uses the set data structure to eliminate duplicates and the lower() method to ensure case insensitivity. The provided test cases validate the function's correctness, including edge cases like an empty string and varying cases of characters."
exp_1_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'parse_music' does not correctly implement the logic to parse the input string and convert musical notes into their corresponding beat values. Instead of parsing the input string and returning a list of integers based on the defined legend, it returns a hardcoded list. This leads to incorrect results for the provided test assertions, which expect the function to dynamically generate the output based on the input string."
exp_1_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'how_many_times' uses the string method 'count', which does not account for overlapping occurrences of the substring. For example, in the string 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', the expected count is 3 (the occurrences are at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but 'count' will return 2. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement to count overlapping cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function sort_numbers does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sort() method sorts the words lexicographically (alphabetically), which does not correspond to their numerical values. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted words, resulting in a concatenated string without spaces. The function should map the words to their corresponding numerical values, sort those values, and then convert them back to words before returning the result."
exp_1_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic used to find the closest pair only tracks the index of one of the closest numbers, but it does not correctly identify the second number. Specifically, the return statement uses 'min_diff_index + 1', which does not guarantee that the second number is the closest to the first. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the closest pair is not adjacent in the original list. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the correct closest pair is (3.9, 4.0), but the function may return (3.9, 5.0) or another incorrect pair depending on the indices tracked."
exp_1_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'rescale_to_unit' is designed to rescale a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output is reversed. The correct output should be [1.0, 0.0] since 100.0 is the maximum and 49.9 is the minimum, but the function does not handle this case correctly. The output should be [1.0, 0.0] as expected, but the function will return [0.0, 1.0] instead. This indicates that the function does not correctly handle cases where the maximum value is the first element and the minimum is the second."
exp_1_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various scenarios, including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass successfully, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_1_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strlen' correctly returns the length of the given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, all of which are correctly handled by the function. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_1_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' is supposed to return the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n'. However, the current implementation starts the loop from 'n' and checks for divisibility, which will always return 'n' itself on the first iteration. This means that the function does not correctly find the largest divisor smaller than 'n'. For example, calling 'largest_divisor(15)' will return 15 instead of 5, which is incorrect. The test cases in the 'check' function also expect the function to return 1 for prime numbers, which is correct, but the implementation fails for composite numbers as described."
exp_1_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the factorize function correctly computes the prime factors of a given integer, including their multiplicities. The function handles even numbers first, then iterates through odd numbers up to the square root of n, which is an efficient approach for factorization. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including prime numbers, powers of primes, and products of distinct primes, and all assertions pass successfully. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_1_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation does not achieve this correctly. The test case assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == [1, 4, 5] fails because the number 3 appears twice and should be removed, but the implementation incorrectly retains the first occurrence of 3. The correct output for this input should be [1, 4, 5], but the function retains elements that appear only once, which is not the intended behavior."
exp_1_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly implements the functionality of flipping the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'swapcase()' effectively changes lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

exp_1_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The function 'concatenate' correctly implements the logic to concatenate a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for both an empty list and a list of strings, returning the correct concatenated result."
exp_1_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')) expects the output to be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA']. The function does not include the last 'xxx' because it is not unique in the list, which is not the expected behavior based on the description. The function should return all instances of strings that start with the prefix, regardless of their uniqueness."
exp_1_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function 'get_positive' correctly implements the logic to filter and return only positive numbers from the input list. The test assertions provided in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various cases, including lists with negative numbers, mixed numbers, and empty lists. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for primality. The loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. It should only check up to the square root of n for factors. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of n being less than 2 correctly, as it should return False for 0 and negative numbers, which it does. However, the inefficiency in the loop can lead to performance issues for larger numbers."
exp_1_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `poly` function contains an error in the polynomial evaluation formula. The comment states that the polynomial should be evaluated as 'xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n', but the code incorrectly uses 'xs[1] * x^2' for both the first and second coefficients. The correct implementation should use 'xs[i] * x^i' for each coefficient, which is what the code attempts to do. However, the comment itself is misleading and incorrect, as it suggests that the first coefficient is multiplied by `x` instead of `x^0`. This discrepancy may lead to confusion. Additionally, the `find_zero` function assumes that the polynomial has a root based on the coefficients provided, but it does not guarantee that the method used will find a root for all polynomials, especially if the polynomial is not well-behaved. The test assertions in the `check` function do not validate the correctness of the `find_zero` function, as they only check if the polynomial evaluates to zero at the found solution without ensuring that the solution is valid for all cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it appends the sorted value of the individual element at that index, which is incorrect. For example, in the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], where the values at indices 0 and 6 (which are divisible by 3) should be sorted together. The current implementation fails to achieve this, leading to incorrect results in the assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly removes duplicates from the list and converts it to a set, but it does not sort the unique elements before returning them. The expected output is a sorted list of unique elements, but the current implementation does not guarantee the order of elements since sets are unordered.

The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum value in that list is actually 124, not 123 as stated in the original docstring. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the implementation does not pass all assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' correctly. The test cases provided in the check function do not match the expected behavior described in the docstring. For example, the expected output for fizz_buzz(78) is 2, but the function does not correctly account for all numbers divisible by 11 or 13 that contain the digit '7'. The function fails to return the correct counts for larger values as well, indicating that the logic for counting occurrences of '7' is flawed or the test cases are incorrect."

The function concatenates the sorted even-indexed values with the odd-indexed values, which results in a list that does not preserve the original order of odd-indexed elements. For example, the input [5, 6, 3, 4] should return [3, 6, 5, 4] according to the description, but the function returns [3, 6, 5, 4] which is correct. However, the second test case fails as it does not maintain the odd indices correctly. The expected output for the second test case is not achieved, indicating that the implementation is flawed."
exp_1_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is incorrectly testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' equals the original string 'str', but it is currently checking 'encode_cyclic(encoded_str)', which does not make sense. Additionally, the 'decode_cyclic' function is not being tested at all. Therefore, the implementation is flawed as it does not validate the correctness of the encoding and decoding process."

The correct values should be candidate(6) == 21 (which is correct) and candidate(11) == 66 (which is also correct). The function itself is implemented correctly, but the test assertions are inconsistent with the expected output for the given inputs."

For each opening bracket '(', it pushes it onto the stack, and for each closing bracket ')', it checks if there is a corresponding opening bracket by checking if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty when encountering a closing bracket, it returns False. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty, which indicates that all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, and the function passes all assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the coefficients of the derivative polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients [a0, a1, a2, ..., an] should be [a1, 2*a2, 3*a3, ..., n*an]. The current implementation incorrectly uses the length of the input list to determine the power of x, which leads to incorrect results. For example, for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the expected derivative is [1, 4, 12, 20], but the function returns [1, 4, 12, 20] correctly. However, for the input [3, 2, 1, 0, 4], the expected derivative is [2, 2, 0, 16], but the function returns [2, 2, 0, 16] correctly. The test case with a single coefficient [1] should return an empty list, which is correct. However, the overall logic for calculating the derivative coefficients is flawed."
exp_1_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function correctly follows the defined rules of the FibFib sequence.

The recursive case correctly sums the values of fibfib(n-1), fibfib(n-2), and fibfib(n-3). The provided test assertions in the check function also confirm that the implementation produces the correct outputs for the specified inputs, including fibfib(5) returning 4, fibfib(8) returning 24, and others. Therefore, the implementation is correct."

Specifically, the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is '001', but the function will return '00' instead, as it does not account for leading zeros when shifting. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' is incorrect because the expected output should be '79', but the function will return '97' since the shift exceeds the number of digits. Thus, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

However, the implementation only extracts the number of apples and oranges from the string using fixed indices (0 and 2), which assumes a specific format. This will fail if the input string format changes or if there are more than two words before 'and'. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion that expects a result of 10 for the input '5 apples and 6 oranges' with a total of 21, which is incorrect as the expected result should be 10. The function does not handle all cases correctly, leading to incorrect results."

While it correctly identifies even numbers and finds the minimum even value, it does not correctly return the index of the first occurrence of that minimum even value. The method 'even_values.index(min(even_values))' will return the index of the first occurrence of the minimum value in the 'even_values' list, which may not correspond to the index in the original 'arr'. This is evident in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) == [0, 1]', where the first occurrence of 0 is at index 1 in 'even_values', but its index in 'arr' is 1, which is correct. However, the test case 'assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 3]) == [0, 3]' will fail because the index of 0 in 'arr' is 3, but the index in 'even_values' will be 0. Thus, the function does not satisfy the requirement of returning the index of the first occurrence of the smallest even value in the original array."
exp_1_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'search' is not implemented, meaning it lacks the necessary logic to fulfill the requirements outlined in the docstring.

exp_1_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly achieve the desired strange sorting order as described in the comments. The current implementation uses 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x%2)', which sorts the list based on whether the numbers are odd or even, rather than alternating between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, such as 'strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])' returning [1, 2, 3, 4] instead of the expected [1, 4, 2, 3]."

The current logic only checks if the number can be expressed as the product of two prime numbers (i and a/i), not three. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the product of three primes is needed, nor does it check for combinations of three primes. The test case assertions also reveal issues: for example, is_multiply_prime(8) should return False (2 * 2 * 2 is not three distinct primes), and is_multiply_prime(125) should return False (5 * 5 * 5 is not three distinct primes). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_1_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function is_simple_power is incorrect because it does not accurately determine if x is a simple power of n. The condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to the way integer conversion and logarithmic calculations work. For example, for is_simple_power(9, 3), the logarithm calculation would yield 2, and thus it would evaluate to 9 == 3**2, which is true, but 9 is indeed a simple power of 3. However, the assertion for candidate(9, 3) in the check function expects it to return True, which contradicts the expected behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x is not a power of n correctly, leading to potential false positives or negatives."

The expression 'a**(1/3) == int(a**(1/3))' does not account for floating-point precision issues, which can lead to incorrect results for certain integers. For example, while it correctly identifies 1, -1, 64, and 0 as cubes, it may fail for other numbers due to rounding errors. A more reliable approach would be to check if the cube of the rounded result of 'a**(1/3)' equals 'a'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect as 1729 is not a perfect cube, but the assertion is checking against 1728 instead."

The condition 'if s[i:i + 3] == s[i + 1:i + 4]' only checks if the first two characters of the 3-character substring are the same, which is insufficient. For example, the string 'abc' would pass this check, but it should return True since all characters are distinct. The correct approach should involve checking if all three characters in the substring are distinct, which can be done by checking if the set of the substring has a length of 3."

Specifically, it returns True for a string of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the loop that checks for factors of the string length does not correctly handle the case when the length is 2, as it should return True for prime lengths. The function should return False for lengths that are divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, and it should also handle edge cases correctly."

However, the implementation counts all n-digit integers that start with 1 or end with 1. For n=1, the only number is 1, which is correct. For n=2, the valid numbers are 10, 11, and 01 (but 01 is not a valid 2-digit number), so the count should be 18 (10-19 and 1x, where x is 0-9). For n=3, the valid numbers are 100-199 (100 numbers) and 1xx (where x can be 0-9, giving 10 more), and also 200-999 (ending with 1), leading to a total of 180 valid numbers. The same logic applies for n=4 and n=5. The function does not account for the fact that leading zeros are not valid in positive integers, which leads to incorrect counts for n > 1."
exp_1_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the sum of the digits of the integer N when represented in binary, but it instead returns the binary representation of N itself. For example, for N = 1000, the binary representation is '1111101000', and the sum of its digits (which is 5) should be converted to binary, resulting in '101'. The test cases provided in the 'check' function expect the output to be the binary representation of the sum of the binary digits, which is not what the current implementation does."

However, the implementation only sums the elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 88])', the function returns 88, which is correct, but in 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', it returns 122, which is incorrect because 5 (at index 1) is not even. The correct implementation should filter for even numbers at odd indices before summing them."
exp_1_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function anti_shuffle does not correctly implement the requirement to sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces in the input string.

For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the expected output is None because there is no distinct second smallest element. However, the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly, as seen in the test case with negative values. The function should first convert the list to a set to remove duplicates before sorting, ensuring that the second smallest element is distinct."

For example, the input 'apple' should return False, but the current implementation would incorrectly return True because it only checks the last character. Additionally, the function does not account for cases where the last character is a letter but is preceded by a space, which should return False.

Additionally, the function does not check if the substring before the dot starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet correctly, as it only checks if the first character is a digit. The function fails to handle various test cases correctly, such as 'I563_No.exe' which should return 'No' due to having more than three digits. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

This means that once an element is squared or cubed, it will affect subsequent calculations in the same iteration, leading to incorrect results. For example, if an index is both a multiple of 3 and 4, it will be squared first and then potentially cubed in the next iteration, which is not intended. The function should instead create a new list to store the modified values before summing them up. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030' fails because the expected output is incorrect based on the function's logic.

This is evident in the test case 'assert candidate([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]', where the output does not preserve the original order of '-1' and '1'.

exp_2_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is incorrect because it uses the 'mean' function without importing it or defining it. Additionally, the calculation of the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is based on the assumption that the mean is correctly calculated, which is not shown in the provided code. The test assertions also indicate that the expected results are incorrect; for example, the expected MAD for the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3, but the actual calculation is not verified due to the missing mean function."
exp_2_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly handle the insertion of the delimiter between all consecutive elements. Specifically, the function currently adds a delimiter after the first element and then recursively processes the rest of the list. This results in an incorrect output for cases where the list has more than two elements. For example, the input [2, 2, 2] with a delimiter of 2 should produce [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation would produce [2, 2, 2, 2], which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve iterating through the list and adding the delimiter between each pair of elements."
exp_2_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. The current approach simply counts the total number of opening and closing parentheses, which does not account for the actual nesting levels. For example, the input '(()())' should return 2, but the implementation would incorrectly return 0 because it computes the difference between the counts of '(' and ')'. A correct implementation would require tracking the current depth as it iterates through the characters in the string and updating the maximum depth accordingly."
exp_2_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_substring is designed to filter strings that contain a given substring. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is incorrect because 'trumpet' and 'gruesome' do not contain the substring 'run', but 'grunt' does. The expected output should be ['grunt'] instead of ['grunt', 'prune']. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the expected results for this test case."
exp_2_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The use of 'reduce' from the 'functools' module is missing, which would cause a NameError. Additionally, the product of an empty list should return 1, but the current implementation will raise an error when trying to compute the product of an empty list. The test cases also reveal that the product of [100, 0] is incorrectly expected to be 0, which is correct, but the implementation does not handle the empty case correctly."
exp_2_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'rolling_max' function correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It iterates through the list, and for each index, it calculates the maximum of the sublist from the start to the current index. The provided test cases in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various scenarios, including an empty list and lists with increasing, decreasing, and mixed values."
exp_2_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is incorrectly implemented. The test assertions provided in the 'check' function are meant to validate the 'make_palindrome' function, but the check is mistakenly applied to 'is_palindrome'. Additionally, the logic in 'make_palindrome' does not correctly construct the shortest palindrome for all cases. For example, the test case 'jerry' should return 'jerryrrej', but the implementation does not guarantee this outcome due to the incorrect handling of the palindromic suffix and prefix concatenation."
exp_2_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '0's and '1's. However, the test case candidate('111000', '101010') is expected to return '010010', which is incorrect. The correct result of the XOR operation for these inputs should be '010010', but the implementation does not handle cases where the strings are of different lengths. The function assumes both strings are of equal length, which leads to incorrect results when they are not. Additionally, the XOR operation is correctly implemented, but the function will raise an error if the lengths of the input strings differ."
exp_2_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `longest` does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the `max` function will return the last occurrence of the maximum length string, which violates this requirement. For example, in the test case `longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])`, the expected output is 'yyy' (the first string with the maximum length), but the current implementation would return 'zzzz'."
exp_2_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test assertions in the check function cover various cases, including coprime numbers (3 and 7), a case with a common divisor (10 and 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49 and 14), and a case with larger numbers (144 and 60). All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected according to the provided examples and additional tests."
exp_2_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,INCORRECT,"The function all_prefixes is expected to return prefixes from shortest to longest, but the implementation includes an empty string as the first prefix. The expected output for an empty input string should be an empty list, but the implementation returns a list that includes an empty string as the first element. The test cases also expect the output to match the specified behavior, which is not satisfied by the current implementation."
exp_2_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The function string_sequence is supposed to return a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 to n inclusive. However, the implementation uses ''.join() without a space delimiter, which results in the numbers being concatenated without spaces. For example, string_sequence(5) would return '012345' instead of '0 1 2 3 4 5'. This is confirmed by the test assertions, which would fail for any n > 0."
exp_2_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters correctly counts the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The implementation uses set to store unique characters after converting the string to lowercase, which aligns with the function's description. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness, including edge cases like an empty string and strings with varying cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical note legend. Instead of returning a list of integers based on the input string, it returns a hardcoded list. The function does not account for the different note representations ('o', 'o|', and '.|') and their corresponding beat values. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for any input other than the hardcoded output."
exp_2_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring within the string. The current approach calculates the difference in length between the original string and the string with the substring removed, which does not account for cases where the substring overlaps. For example, in the case of 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', the expected count is 3 (the overlaps 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the implementation would return 2. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sort method used on the list of words sorts them lexicographically (alphabetically) rather than numerically. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect for numerical order. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which causes the output to be concatenated without spaces between the words."
exp_2_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic used to find the closest pair only tracks the index of one of the closest elements, but it does not correctly identify the second closest element. Specifically, it always returns the element at 'min_diff_index' and the next element in the list, which may not be the closest pair. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the expected output is (3.9, 4.0), but the function would incorrectly return (3.9, 2.2) or similar incorrect pairs depending on the indices. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_2_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the minimum and maximum values are the same. In such cases, the denominator (max_val - min_val) becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. For example, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because it expects the output to be [1.0, 0.0], but the function will raise an error due to division by zero. The function should include a check to handle this scenario."
exp_2_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions also cover various cases, including empty lists and lists with mixed types, and they confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_2_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the correctness of 'strlen' against various cases, including an empty string and non-empty strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_2_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is supposed to return the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. However, the implementation starts checking from n down to 1, and it will return n itself if n is a prime number (e.g., for n = 3 or n = 7). The correct behavior should return 1 for prime numbers, as 1 is the only divisor smaller than the number itself. The test cases in the check function expect this behavior, which the current implementation does not satisfy."
exp_2_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'factorize' does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. The inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect factorization, especially for composite numbers. For example, when testing with 'factorize(70)', the expected output is [2, 5, 7], but the function may not produce this result consistently due to the way it handles the factorization. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input number is prime or where multiple factors are present correctly, as it stops after finding the first factor. This leads to incorrect results for various test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation does not correctly achieve this. The current implementation retains elements that occur only once, but it does not remove all duplicates as specified. For example, the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) is expected to return [1, 4, 5], but it fails to account for the fact that both 2 and 3 appear more than once and should be removed entirely. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly uses the 'swapcase()' method to flip the case of each character in the input string.

All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_2_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')) is expected to return ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but it actually returns ['xxx', 'xxx'] because the function does not account for case sensitivity and does not include 'xxxAAA' as it does not start with 'xxx' in a case-sensitive manner. The expected output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] but the actual output is ['xxx', 'xxx']."
exp_2_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function 'get_positive' correctly implements the logic to filter out only positive numbers from the input list. The list comprehension used in the function effectively checks each element 'x' in the list 'l' and includes it in the result if 'x' is greater than 0.

exp_2_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for primality. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so it suffices to check for factors up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of 0 and negative numbers correctly, as they should also return False. The test cases include checks for 5, 17, and composite numbers that are not handled correctly by the current implementation."
exp_2_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `find_zero` function is incorrect. The logic used to find the zero of the polynomial does not guarantee that it will find a root correctly. The method of calculating `x` by iterating through half of the coefficients and performing a subtraction does not correspond to any standard root-finding algorithm. Additionally, the test assertions in the `check` function are designed to validate the `find_zero` function, but it incorrectly checks the `poly` function instead. The `check` function should be testing `find_zero`, not `poly`, which leads to a mismatch in the expected behavior."
exp_2_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' is incorrect because it does not properly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it appends the sorted result of the individual elements (which is incorrect since 'l[i]' is an integer and 'sorted(l[i])' is invalid). The correct approach should involve collecting the values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back into their respective positions in the new list while keeping other values unchanged."
exp_2_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list.

exp_2_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function max_element is correct, as it uses the built-in max function to return the maximum element from the list. However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The second assertion checks for the maximum value in the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], which should return 124, but the provided test case in the docstring indicates that the maximum value is 123. This discrepancy indicates that the test cases are not aligned with the expected output, leading to an incorrect evaluation of the function."
exp_2_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the fizz_buzz function correctly counts the occurrences of the digit '7' in integers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. The test assertions provided in the check function validate the correctness of the implementation against expected outputs for various inputs. The function iterates through the range from 1 to n-1, checks divisibility by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of '7' in those numbers, which aligns with the function's description."
exp_2_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly maintain the values at odd indices while sorting the even indices. The implementation concatenates the sorted even indices with the odd indices, but it does not place the odd indices back into their original positions in the final list. For example, in the test case 'sort_even([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])', the expected output is '[-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123]', but the function returns '[-12, 3, 5, 2, -3, 3, 8, 0, 9, 1, 123]', which is incorrect."

However, the implementation only handles the first two cases (n = 1 and n = 2) correctly by returning 2 and 3, respectively. For n >= 3, it calls a function 'fib(n)', which is not defined in the provided code. This will lead to a NameError when n is greater than 2. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime; thus, the function does not correctly implement the requirement to find Fibonacci numbers that are also prime."
exp_2_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify all combinations of three distinct elements that sum to zero. The initial check for zero is misleading and does not relate to the requirement of finding three distinct elements. Additionally, the nested loops do not guarantee that the elements are distinct due to the way duplicates are handled. For example, the input [1, 3, -2, 1] should return True, but the logic may fail in certain cases where duplicates are present. The test cases also include scenarios that are not adequately covered by the implementation."

The current implementation only checks for lowercase vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and will miss uppercase vowels and the condition for 'y'. For example, 'Alone' should return 3 (counting 'A', 'o', 'e'), and 'key' should return 2 (counting 'e' and 'y'). Additionally, the test cases do not cover all scenarios, such as words ending with 'y' or containing uppercase vowels."

According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the string representation of 'x' when the shift is greater than the length of 'x', which is correct. The issue arises with the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""', which fails because the expected output is incorrect. The correct output for 'circular_shift(100, 2)' should be '00' (the last two digits shifted to the front), not '001'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the expected behavior as described in the comments."

exp_2_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'fruit_distribution' does not correctly handle the extraction of the number of oranges from the input string. The code assumes that the number of oranges is always at the second position in the split string, which is not guaranteed. For example, in the test case '1 apples and 100 oranges', the function will incorrectly extract '0' instead of '100' for the number of oranges, leading to incorrect results. The correct extraction should account for the variable position of the orange count in the string."
exp_2_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly return the index of the smallest even value. The issue arises because the index is being calculated based on the list of even values, which does not correspond to the original array's indices. For example, in the case of the input [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2], the smallest even value is 0, which appears at indices 1 and 3 in the original array. The function will return [0, 1] instead of [0, 1] as expected, but it will fail for other cases where the smallest even value appears multiple times. The index should be derived from the original array, not from the filtered list of even values."

The current logic sorts the list and checks each integer against its frequency, but it returns the first integer that satisfies the condition, rather than the greatest one. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1, but the function will return 5, which is incorrect. Additionally, the frequency check is done using 'lst.count(lst[i])', which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results if the list contains duplicates. The function should instead iterate through unique values and check their frequencies to find the maximum valid integer."
exp_2_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly sort the list in the specified 'strange order'. The current implementation simply returns the first element, recursively processes the rest of the list, and appends the last element, which does not achieve the desired alternating minimum and maximum sorting. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4] should yield [1, 4, 2, 3], but the current implementation would not produce this result. The function needs to be restructured to properly alternate between the minimum and maximum values from the remaining elements."

The formula used, round(0.5 * (a * b * c) ** (1/2), 2), does not represent the correct method for calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides. The correct method is to use Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for the test case triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433. Therefore, the function fails to produce the correct area for valid triangles and does not handle the area calculation properly."

According to the problem description, an empty list should return False, which the current implementation does correctly. However, the logic for checking if the list is balanced (palindromic) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight is flawed. Specifically, the function first checks if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to w, and only then checks if the list is a palindrome. This means that if the sum exceeds w, it does not check for balance at all, which is incorrect. The function should first check if the list is a palindrome and then check the sum against w. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input list contains negative numbers or non-integer values, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_2_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `smallest_change` is overly complex and does not correctly handle all cases for arrays of length greater than 5. The logic is hardcoded for specific lengths, which limits its functionality and correctness. For example, it does not correctly calculate the number of changes needed for arrays longer than 5 elements. The test cases provided in the `check` function include scenarios that the current implementation cannot handle correctly, leading to incorrect results. A more generalized approach using a two-pointer technique would be more appropriate to determine the minimum changes needed to make the array palindromic."

According to the function's description, if one list has a total character count less than the other, it should return that list. However, when the first list is empty and the second list is not (e.g., total_match([], ['this'])), the function incorrectly returns the first list (which is empty) instead of the second list. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is incorrect because the total character count of the second list is greater than that of the first list, so the expected output should be ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, the implementation only checks if the number can be divided by a prime number and then checks if the quotient is also prime. This approach does not guarantee that the number is a product of exactly three primes. For example, the number 8 (which is 2 * 2 * 2) is incorrectly asserted to be true, as it is not a product of three distinct primes. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where the product of three primes could include repetitions or combinations that do not yield a valid product of three primes. The test cases also include incorrect assertions, such as 125 being true, which is not a product of three primes. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the function's docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' is incorrect. The condition 'if x == n ** int(x / n)' does not correctly determine if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. The expression 'int(x / n)' does not yield the correct exponent for checking if 'n' raised to that exponent equals 'x'. Instead, the function should check if there exists an integer 'k' such that 'n**k = x'. The test cases also reveal that the function fails to return the expected results for certain inputs, such as 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' which should return True, but the current implementation would not handle this correctly."

The expression 'a**(1/3) == int(a**(1/3))' does not account for floating-point precision issues, which can lead to incorrect results for certain integers. For example, 'iscube(8)' would return False because '8**(1/3)' is approximately 2.0, and 'int(2.0)' is 2, which does not equal 2.0. A more reliable approach would be to check if the cube of the rounded value of 'a**(1/3)' equals 'a'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect; it should check '1728', which is a perfect cube (12^3)."

However, the implementation only counts the occurrences of the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F, which are not all prime digits. The prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), and D (13). The function fails to account for the digits '2', '3', '5', and '7', which are also prime. Therefore, the output of the function will not match the expected results for the provided test cases."

The current implementation only checks if any three consecutive letters are the same, which is not sufficient. For example, the string 'abcabc' should return True because all groups of three consecutive letters ('abc', 'bca', 'cab') are distinct, but the current implementation would incorrectly return False because it does not account for distinctness across the entire string. The correct logic should check if s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] are all different."

Specifically, the function incorrectly assigns the letter grade 'D+' for a GPA of exactly 1.0, while it should assign 'D' for any GPA less than 1.0 and greater than or equal to 0.7. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where a GPA of 0.0 should return 'E'. The expected output for the test case 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' is incorrect; it should return 'C-' instead of 'D+'. The grading logic needs to be adjusted to ensure it follows the specified ranges accurately."
exp_2_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prime_length' is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether the length of the string is a prime number.

However, for n = 2, the numbers that start or end with 1 are 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, and 1, which gives a total of 18. The function correctly returns 18 for n = 2, but it does not scale well for larger n. The correct approach would involve calculating the counts mathematically rather than iterating through all possibilities. For n = 3, the count should be 180, but the function's method of counting may lead to inefficiencies and potential inaccuracies for larger n."

However, for N = 150, the sum of its digits is 6, and the expected output is '110', but the function will return '10010110', which is the binary representation of 150. Similarly, for N = 147, the sum of its digits is 12, and the expected output is '1100', but the function will return '10010011'.

The function only checks the length of the array and does not sort the array correctly for lengths greater than 2. Additionally, the function does not return a sorted copy of the array; it simply returns the original array in reverse order for even sums, which is not the intended behavior. The correct implementation should sort the array in ascending order if the sum is odd and in descending order if the sum is even, regardless of the length of the array."
exp_2_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encrypt' function does not correctly perform the intended rotation of the alphabet. The function is overly complicated and does not effectively shift the letters by two positions down the alphabet.

For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the function returns 1, which is incorrect because there is no distinct second smallest element. The function should return None in such cases. Additionally, the case next_smallest([1, 0**0]) is also problematic because 0**0 is considered 1 in Python, leading to the same issue.

For example, the input 'I love It !' should return 1, but the current implementation would not correctly identify the sentence structure.

However, for multiply(148, 412), the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16, which is also correct. The test case multiply(14, -15) should return 20, but the unit digits are 4 and 5, which multiply to 20, so this is also correct. The issue arises with the test case multiply(76, 67), which should return 42, but the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42, making this correct as well. The function fails to account for negative numbers correctly in the context of the problem description, which states that the input is always valid.

The problem statement specifies that the input should be an array of non-negative integers, but the test cases include negative integers. The expected outputs in the test cases do not match the actual outputs produced by the function. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]) == [-4, -2, -6, -5, -3]' is incorrect because the function does not account for negative numbers, which are not valid inputs according to the problem description."

First, it converts the entire word to lowercase, which causes it to lose case sensitivity, contradicting the requirement to return vowels in a case-sensitive manner. Additionally, the function does not correctly identify the closest vowel between two consonants; it simply returns the character immediately after the second consonant without checking if it is a vowel. For example, in the test case get_closest_vowel('FULL'), it returns 'u' as expected, but for 'full', it incorrectly returns 'u' instead of 'U'. The test cases also include 'Above', which should return 'o' but would not be handled correctly due to the lowercase conversion. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

Additionally, the base case for k == 1 does not check if the single element is within the two-digit limit. The function needs to filter the elements based on their digit count before summing them."

Additionally, the logic for counting lowercase letters with odd positions in the alphabet is incorrect; it should count letters based on their positions rather than using the `count` method. The test cases also reveal that the function does not handle cases with mixed punctuation correctly, such as 'Hello,Hello,world !'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

For example, for the input [1, 2, 2, -4], the expected output is -9, but the function will return -1 (the product of the signs) instead. Additionally, the function returns 0 immediately if any element is zero, which is not aligned with the requirement to return the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of signs. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The condition ']' in string and '[' in string and ']' in string.replace('[', '') is insufficient. For example, it would return True for the input '[]', which does not contain any nested brackets. The function fails to check for actual nesting, which requires that there be at least one pair of brackets where one is inside another, such as in '[[]]'. Therefore, the implementation does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the function description."

The math.ceil function rounds towards positive infinity, which means that for negative numbers, it will round to a less negative number (closer to zero). For example, math.ceil(-2.4) results in -2, and when squared, it gives 4 instead of the expected 6 when summed with the squares of the other numbers. Therefore, the output for the test case [-2.4,1,1] is incorrect."

However, this does not align with the requirement that the last character should not be part of a word. For example, in the case of 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed a letter and is not part of a word, so it should return True. However, the implementation incorrectly checks if 'e' is not in 'apple pi ', which is not the intended logic. Thus, the function fails to return the correct results for the provided test cases."

The current implementation only updates 'a' if it finds a negative integer that is greater than the current value of 'a'. However, it should be tracking the largest negative integer, which means it should update 'a' if it finds a negative integer that is less than the current value of 'a'. For example, in the case of the input [-1, -3, -5, -6], the function returns -1, which is correct, but in the case of [-6, -4, -4, -3, 1], it incorrectly returns -3 instead of -4, which is the largest negative integer. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no positive integers correctly, as it returns None for 'b' but does not account for the absence of positive integers in the logic."

The current implementation checks if n is equal to the sum of all even numbers up to n, which does not align with the requirement of summing exactly 4 positive even numbers. For example, the sum of the first four positive even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) is 20, and the function would incorrectly return results based on the total sum of even numbers rather than checking combinations of exactly four even numbers."

The current implementation only checks if the substring before the dot has more than three characters, which is incorrect. Additionally, it does not count the digits in the entire file name. For example, 'MY16FILE3.exe' should return 'No' because it contains four digits. Furthermore, the check for the substring before the dot being empty is not explicitly handled, as it only checks the length of the substring but does not ensure it starts with a letter. The function also fails to return 'No' for cases where the file name has multiple dots or invalid extensions. Therefore, the function does not meet all the specified conditions for a valid file name."

However, the current implementation first squares the number at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 3, and then it checks if 'i' is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3 to cube it. This means that if 'i' is both a multiple of 3 and 4 (like 0, 12, etc.), it will only be squared and not cubed, which is incorrect. Additionally, the test cases include scenarios that are not covered by the function's logic, leading to incorrect results for those cases. For example, the test case with input [-56,-99,1,0,-2] should yield a different result than what the function currently produces."

Additionally, the output string is constructed without spaces between the words, which contradicts the requirement to maintain the order and separation of words from the original sentence. The test cases also include assertions that expect certain outputs which will not be met due to these issues."

The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality rather than determining if the product is a whole number. To check if the product x * n is a whole number, we should verify if (x_num * n_num) is divisible by (x_den * n_den). This means the correct condition should be 'if (x_num * n_num) % (x_den * n_den) == 0'. As a result, the function will fail for some test cases, such as 'simplify(""1/5"", ""1/5"")' which should return True, but will return False due to the incorrect logic."

For example, for the number 125, the first digit is 1 (which is odd), but the condition will fail because 12 (the result of num // 10) is even. Therefore, the function will incorrectly count numbers that have an odd first digit but an even second digit. The test cases provided in the 'check' function may pass for some cases, but they will fail for others where the first digit is odd but the second digit is even."

This means that it could potentially skip over an extension that should be selected based on its position in the list. For example, if the extensions are ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A'], the function would incorrectly return 'C' instead of the first 'A' if they have the same strength."

exp_3_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly handle the case where the input list has more than one element. The function recursively adds the first element, then the delimiter, and calls itself with the rest of the list. However, this leads to an incorrect output because it adds an extra delimiter at the end of the list. For example, calling intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2) should yield [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation would produce [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. The function needs to ensure that the delimiter is only added between elements and not after the last element."
exp_3_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group. Instead of counting the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses, it simply counts the total number of parentheses in the entire string. This leads to incorrect results, as the depth of nesting should be calculated for each individual group of parentheses separately. The correct approach would involve iterating through each character in the string, maintaining a counter for the current depth, and updating the maximum depth for each group accordingly."
exp_3_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_substring is intended to filter strings that contain the specified substring. However, the test case 'check' includes an assertion that expects 'grunt' and 'prune' to be returned when filtering with the substring 'run'. Neither 'grunt' nor 'prune' contains the substring 'run', which makes this assertion incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The 'reduce' function is not imported from 'functools', which will lead to a NameError. Additionally, the product of an empty list should return 1, but if 'numbers' is empty, 'reduce' will not execute and will return the default value of 1, which is correct. However, if the list contains a zero, the product will incorrectly return 0 instead of the expected behavior of returning the product of all numbers. The test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)' is also misleading as it suggests that the product should be 0, which is correct, but does not test the function's behavior with an empty list. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements stated in the docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'rolling_max' function does not handle the case when the input list is empty. When an empty list is passed, it will raise an IndexError because it tries to access the first element of the list with 'numbers[0]'. Additionally, the expected output for the test case 'rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4])' is incorrect; the output should be [1, 2, 3, 4], which is correct, but the function does not handle the empty list case properly."
exp_3_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' is correctly implemented, but the function 'make_palindrome' does not produce the expected results for all test cases. Specifically, the test case 'make_palindrome('jerry')' should return 'jerryrrej', but the implementation does not correctly append the necessary characters to form a palindrome. The logic in the loop that constructs the palindrome is flawed, as it does not correctly handle the case where the longest palindromic prefix is not at the end of the string."
exp_3_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. For example, if 'a' is '010' and 'b' is '110', the function will only process the first three characters of each string, which is correct in this case. However, the test case '111000' and '101010' will yield '010010', which is incorrect because the function does not account for the lengths of the strings. The expected output for '111000' XOR '101010' should be '010010', which is correct, but the implementation will fail for cases where the lengths differ. Therefore, the implementation is not robust and does not meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_3_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the use of 'max' with 'key=len' will return the last string with the maximum length instead of the first one. For example, in the test case 'check(candidate(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])', the expected output is 'yyy' since it is the first string of maximum length 3, but the function will return 'zzzz'."
exp_3_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test assertions in the check function cover various cases, including coprime numbers (3, 7), a case with a common divisor (10, 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49, 14), and a case with larger numbers (144, 60). All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_3_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over the range of the string's length plus one, which includes the empty prefix. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various scenarios, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, all of which return the expected results."
exp_3_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The correct implementation should use ' '.join(...) instead of ''.join(...). This leads to the output being a concatenation of numbers without spaces, which fails the provided test assertions."
exp_3_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly counts the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The use of 'set' ensures that only unique characters are considered, and converting the string to lowercase before creating the set effectively handles case insensitivity. The provided test cases validate the function's correctness, including edge cases like an empty string and varying cases of the same characters."
exp_3_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the musical notes according to the specified format. The function treats each character in the input string individually, which leads to incorrect parsing of multi-character notes like 'o|' and '.|'. Instead, it should split the input string into separate notes and then evaluate each note. For example, the input 'o| o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o' would not be parsed correctly, resulting in an incorrect output."
exp_3_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'how_many_times' does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string. The method 'string.count(substring)' only counts non-overlapping occurrences. For example, in the case of 'how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')', the expected result is 3 (the occurrences are 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the current implementation would return 2. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sorting is done lexicographically (alphabetically) rather than numerically. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect in terms of numerical order. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which results in the output being concatenated without spaces. The expected output for the test case 'five zero four seven nine eight' should be 'zero four five seven eight nine', but the current implementation would not produce this correctly."
exp_3_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic only tracks the index of one of the closest elements but does not find the correct pair. Specifically, it returns 'numbers[min_diff_index]' and 'numbers[min_diff_index + 1]', which does not guarantee that these two numbers are the closest to each other. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the expected output is (3.9, 4.0), but the function would return (2.2, 3.9) instead, which is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is correct in terms of rescaling the values between 0 and 1. However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [1.0, 0.0] but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] due to the order of the inputs. The function does not handle the case where the maximum value comes first in the input list correctly, as it assumes the minimum value will always be the first element. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall implementation is not correct."
exp_3_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose as described in the docstring. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various cases, including empty lists and lists with mixed types, and the function returns the expected results in all cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of the given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various inputs, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_3_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is intended to find the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. However, the implementation starts the loop from n and includes n in the range, which causes it to return n instead of the largest divisor smaller than n. For example, calling largest_divisor(3) returns 3 instead of 1, which is incorrect. The loop should start from n-1 to ensure that the returned divisor is always smaller than n."
exp_3_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'factorize' function correctly computes the prime factors of the input integer 'n' and returns them in the expected order. The function handles both even and odd factors appropriately, and the provided test cases cover a variety of scenarios, all of which pass successfully. The output matches the expected results as described in the function's docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation incorrectly retains elements that appear only once. The test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) is expected to return [1, 4, 5], which is correct according to the description, but the implementation does not correctly handle the removal of duplicates. The logic used in the list comprehension does not account for the frequency of elements, leading to incorrect results."
exp_3_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly implements the behavior described in the docstring. It uses the 'swapcase' method to flip the case of each character in the input string, which is confirmed by the provided test assertions.

exp_3_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'concatenate' function correctly concatenates a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the behavior of the 'concatenate' function against the expected outputs, confirming that it handles both an empty list and a list of strings correctly."
exp_3_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings that start with the given prefix. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function do not fully validate the expected behavior of the function. Specifically, the second assertion expects the output to be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list and should only be included once in the output. Therefore, the test case does not match the expected output, leading to an incorrect evaluation."
exp_3_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function 'get_positive' correctly implements the logic to return only positive numbers from the input list. The list comprehension used in the function filters out non-positive numbers (i.e., numbers less than or equal to zero). The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the correctness of 'get_positive' against various scenarios, including lists with negative numbers, a mix of positive and negative numbers, an empty list, and a list with only negative numbers. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_3_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function is incorrect because it checks for factors from 2 to n-1. This is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results for larger numbers. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case for numbers that are prime but greater than 2, as it will check all numbers up to n, which is unnecessary. A more efficient approach would be to check for factors only up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for even numbers greater than 2 efficiently, as it checks all numbers up to n. The test cases provided in the 'check' function are correct, but the implementation fails to pass them for larger prime numbers due to inefficiency."
exp_3_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'find_zero' is intended to find a root of a polynomial defined by its coefficients, but it does not correctly implement a root-finding algorithm. The current implementation simply computes a value based on the coefficients without ensuring that it finds a root where poly(xs, x) = 0. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the 'find_zero' function, but they incorrectly reference 'poly' instead of 'find_zero'. This leads to a failure in the test as 'poly' does not return a root. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it appends the sorted value of the individual element 'l[i]' (which is incorrect). The correct approach should involve collecting all values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back at the respective indices in the new list. The test assertions will fail as a result of this incorrect logic."
exp_3_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list.

The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum element in the list is actually 124, not 123 as stated in the docstring. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed."
exp_3_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. However, the implementation only counts how many numbers contain the digit '7' without correctly handling the divisibility condition. For instance, the number 77 is divisible by both 11 and 13, but the function does not correctly account for all occurrences of '7' in such numbers. The test assertions indicate that the expected results are based on the correct interpretation of the problem, but the implementation fails to meet these expectations."
exp_3_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly implement the sorting of even indices while preserving the values at odd indices. The function sorts both even and odd indexed values, which is not the intended behavior. Additionally, it reverses both lists before combining them, which further deviates from the expected output.

exp_3_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing 'encode_cyclic' instead of 'decode_cyclic'. The assertion should compare the output of 'decode_cyclic' with the original string, not 'encode_cyclic'. This means that the test is not verifying the correctness of the decoding function, which is the intended purpose of the check."
exp_3_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prime_fib' is incorrect because it does not properly generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality. The function calls 'fib(n)' to get the n-th Fibonacci number, but it does not increment 'n' in the while loop to find the next Fibonacci number if the current one is not prime. As a result, it will repeatedly check the same Fibonacci number until it finds a prime, which is not the intended behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are no prime Fibonacci numbers for higher values of 'n'. The test assertions include values for n up to 10, which are expected to return the correct prime Fibonacci numbers, but the implementation will fail for these cases due to the reasons mentioned."
exp_3_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it only checks for the sum of three consecutive elements after sorting the list. This approach does not account for the requirement of finding any three distinct elements that sum to zero. For example, in the case of the input [2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7], the correct triplet (-5, 2, 3) sums to zero, but the current implementation would not find it since it only checks adjacent elements in the sorted list. A proper implementation should use a nested loop or a hash set to check all combinations of three distinct elements."
exp_3_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it contains only a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not produce any output or perform any calculations.

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2], but the correct output from 'incr_list' would be [4, 3, 2].

Therefore, while the function is correct, the test cases contain incorrect expected outputs."
exp_3_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function pairs_sum_to_zero is incorrect because it uses a recursive approach that checks for pairs by removing one element at a time and checking the rest of the list. This leads to incorrect results, especially for cases where the two elements that sum to zero are not adjacent. For example, in the test case pairs_sum_to_zero([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30]), the correct pairs are -3 and 3, but the function may not find them due to its flawed logic. A more efficient approach would be to use a set to track the complements of the numbers seen so far, which would allow for a direct check of whether the required pair exists."

The correct conversion should yield '100', but the implementation does not account for this, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the test case 'change_base(234, 2)' is expected to return '11101010', which is correct, but the function's logic does not guarantee that all conversions will be accurate for all inputs within the specified constraints."

The correct results for these cases should be 0 and 1 respectively, as 2^30 modulo 5 is 0 and 2^31 modulo 5 is 1. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all the provided test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the encode_shift function is incorrect because it does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet ('a' to 'z'). The decode_shift function is also incorrect for the same reason. Both functions assume that all input characters are lowercase letters, which leads to incorrect behavior when non-lowercase characters are present. Additionally, the check function is incorrectly testing encode_shift instead of decode_shift, as it is asserting that the encoded string can be decoded back to the original string using the same function."

The correct values for fibfib(10) and fibfib(12) should be 81 and 274 respectively, but the function does not return these values, indicating a logical error in the computation."
exp_3_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' does not correctly account for the condition that 'y' is only considered a vowel when it is at the end of the word. The current implementation counts 'y' as a vowel in all positions, which leads to incorrect results for test cases such as 'key' and 'bye'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly, as it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases provided also do not cover all edge cases, such as empty strings or strings without vowels."
exp_3_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits correctly. According to the function description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is greater than the length of the string representation of the number. The test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is '001', but the actual output is '100' since the function does not account for leading zeros. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' fails because the expected output is '79', but the actual output is '97' since the shift exceeds the number of digits. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the number of oranges is greater than 0 but not explicitly mentioned in the test cases. The test case 'assert candidate(""5 apples and 6 oranges"",21) == 10' is incorrect because it expects the function to return 10, but the function will return 21 - 5 - 6 = 10, which is correct. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""1 apples and 100 oranges"",120) == 19' is also misleading because it expects 19, but the function will return 120 - 1 - 100 = 19, which is correct. The function does not account for potential variations in the input string format, such as additional spaces or different word orders, which could lead to incorrect parsing. Therefore, while the logic of the function is mostly correct, the test cases do not comprehensively validate the function's robustness against various input formats."
exp_3_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' has a logical flaw in how it determines the index of the smallest even value. The current approach first finds the minimum even value and then uses 'even_values.index(min(even_values))' to find its index in the original array. This will fail if the smallest even value appears multiple times, as it will always return the index of the first occurrence in the 'even_values' list, which may not correspond to its index in the original array. For example, in the case of 'candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])', the function will return [0, 1], but the correct output should be [0, 1] since the first occurrence of 0 is at index 1. However, if the input were 'candidate([0, 0, 1])', it would incorrectly return the index of the first 0, which is correct, but if the input were 'candidate([2, 0, 2])', it would incorrectly return the index of the first 2 instead of the first 0. The function needs to be modified to track both the minimum even value and its index in a single pass through the array."

The function sorts the list and then checks each integer against hardcoded conditions, which does not account for the frequency of each integer in the list. The function should count the occurrences of each integer and then find the maximum integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. As a result, the function fails to return the correct values for many test cases, such as 'search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4])' which should return -1 but does not."
exp_3_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly achieve the desired 'strange sorting' as described in the comments. The sorting logic using 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x, -x))' does not alternate between the minimum and maximum values as required. Instead, it sorts the list in a regular order, which does not match the expected output for the provided test cases. For example, 'strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])' should return '[1, 4, 2, 3]', but the current implementation would return '[1, 2, 3, 4]'. Therefore, the function fails to satisfy the requirements outlined in the docstring."

The formula used, (a * b * c) / (4 * (a + b + c)), does not yield the correct area for a triangle given its side lengths. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its side lengths a, b, and c is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for the triangle with sides (1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433. Therefore, the function fails to produce the correct results for the provided test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly checks if the list q is balanced (palindromic) and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight w.

Instead, it only compares the lengths of the lists themselves. The function should sum the lengths of all strings in each list and then compare those sums to determine which list has fewer total characters. As a result, the function fails to return the correct list in cases where the total character counts are different but the list lengths are the same."
exp_3_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of three prime numbers. However, the current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as the product of two prime factors (i and a/i). It does not account for the requirement of three prime factors. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the product of three primes is needed, leading to incorrect results for inputs like 8, 10, and 125. The test cases also indicate that the function fails to return the expected results for several inputs, confirming that the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_3_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' is incorrect because it does not properly check if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. The condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to the way integer division and logarithmic calculations work. For example, for 'is_simple_power(9, 3)', the logarithm will yield a value that, when converted to an integer, does not accurately represent the power needed to reach 'x'. This results in incorrect evaluations for several test cases, such as 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True', which should return False. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 1 correctly, which can lead to further logical errors."
exp_3_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The function iscube(a) incorrectly checks if a is a perfect cube. The expression 'a**(1/3) == int(a**(1/3))' does not account for floating-point precision issues, which can lead to incorrect results for certain integers. For example, iscube(1729) should return False, but the test checks candidate(1728), which is not the same. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly since the cube root of a negative number is also negative, and the comparison with int() could fail due to precision errors."
exp_3_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'hex_key' is designed to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string. However, it does not correctly handle the input type as it assumes the input will always be a string. The test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is invalid because it passes an empty list instead of a string, which would lead to a TypeError when the function tries to iterate over it. Additionally, the function does not account for the prime digit 'A' (which is 10 in decimal) and incorrectly includes 'B' (11 in decimal) and 'D' (13 in decimal) as prime digits. The correct prime hexadecimal digits should be '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', and 'D', but the function is not designed to handle the input correctly in all cases."

exp_3_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for distinct characters among every three consecutive letters. The current logic only checks if three consecutive letters are the same, which is not sufficient to determine if they are distinct. For example, the string 'abc' would return True, but 'aab' would also return True, even though 'aab' contains non-distinct characters. The correct implementation should ensure that all three characters are distinct, which is not achieved in the current code."
exp_3_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values that fall on the boundary conditions. For example, the GPA of 3.0 should yield 'B+' according to the grading table, but the implementation incorrectly assigns 'B+' to any GPA greater than or equal to 3.0. Additionally, the GPA of 1.0 should yield 'D+' but the implementation incorrectly assigns 'D+' to any GPA greater than or equal to 1.0. The correct implementation should use '>' for all conditions except for the highest grade (4.0) and the lowest grade (0.0)."
exp_3_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' incorrectly identifies the length of the string 'orange' as not prime, returning False, which is correct. However, it fails to handle the case when the string length is 1 correctly, as 1 is not a prime number. The function should return False for strings of length 1. Additionally, the logic for checking prime numbers is flawed; it should check divisibility only up to the square root of the length, and it should also account for lengths less than 2. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_3_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' is not correctly counting the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The current implementation iterates through all n-digit integers and checks if they start or end with '1', which is inefficient and may lead to performance issues for larger n. Additionally, the expected results in the assertions are incorrect. For n=1, the only 1-digit number is '1', so the count is 1. For n=2, the valid numbers are 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, and 1, 21, ..., 91, which gives a total of 18. However, for n=3, the count should be 180, as there are 100 numbers starting with '1' (100-199) and 80 ending with '1' (101, 111, ..., 191, plus 201, 211, ..., 991). The function does not account for double counting numbers that both start and end with '1'. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer N, but it instead returns the binary representation of N itself.

However, for N = 150, the sum of its digits is 6, and the expected output is '110', but the function will return '10010110' (the binary representation of 150). Similarly, for N = 147, the sum of its digits is 12, and the expected output is '1100', but the function will return '10010011' (the binary representation of 147). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

However, the implementation currently sums the elements at even indices instead (using range(0, len(lst), 2)). This is a logical error in the index selection. For example, in the input [4, 2, 6, 7], the only even number at an odd index is 2, which is correctly returned as 2 in the example, but the implementation does not consistently apply this logic across all test cases. The assertions in the 'check' function do not align with the intended functionality of the 'add' function."
exp_3_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'anti_shuffle' does not correctly sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces. The current implementation uses 'sorted(s.split())', which sorts the list of words instead of sorting the characters within each individual word. For example, 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation would not achieve this as it does not sort the characters of 'Hello' and 'World!!!' separately."
exp_3_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates of each row by columns in descending order. After the first sorting by rows, the second sorting is done by columns in ascending order instead of descending order. This leads to incorrect results for cases where multiple occurrences of 'x' exist in the same row. For example, in the test case with the input [[1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,4,1,6], [1,2,3,4,5,1]], the expected output is [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)], but the implementation does not produce this result due to incorrect sorting logic."
exp_3_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' does not correctly handle the sorting logic based on the sum of the first and last elements of the array. Specifically, the conditions for checking whether the sum is even or odd are incorrectly implemented. The expression 'array[0] + array[n] % 2' does not group the addition correctly due to operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluations. Additionally, the function does not sort the array as required; it simply returns the original array in cases where the sum is even. The function also has unnecessary repetitive code for different lengths of the array, which could be simplified. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_3_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encrypt' function does not correctly perform the encryption as described. The function is supposed to rotate the alphabet by two positions for each letter in the input string, but the current implementation does not achieve this. Instead, it creates a new alphabet string that is not used to map the input characters to their encrypted counterparts. The function lacks the logic to replace each character in the input string with the corresponding character from the new alphabet. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."

For example, in the case of next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected output is None, but the function incorrectly returns 1 because it sorts the list and returns the second element, which is still 1. Additionally, the case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -34, not -35, as -34 is the second smallest element. The function fails to account for duplicates and negative numbers correctly."
exp_3_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' only checks for sentences that are split by the '.' character. However, the problem statement specifies that sentences can also be delimited by '?' and '!'. As a result, the function will not correctly count sentences that start with 'I' if they are followed by these other delimiters. For example, the input 'I love this?

exp_3_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'any_int' does not correctly check if all three numbers are integers before evaluating the condition. The method 'is_integer()' is only called on 'x', and it will raise an AttributeError if 'x' is not a float.

For example, the vowel 'a' should be replaced with 'c', 'e' with 'g', 'i' with 'k', 'o' with 'q', and 'u' with 'w'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case swapping correctly, as it only converts the entire message to lowercase at the beginning.

The condition 'elif key.isupper() != key.islower()' will always evaluate to True for any string key, as a string cannot be both upper and lower case simultaneously. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the keys are mixed case or not strings. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the dictionary is empty, as it returns False as expected, but the logic for checking the case of the keys is flawed."
exp_3_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'count_up_to' is incorrect because it does not return the correct list of prime numbers less than 'n'. For example, 'count_up_to(6)' should return [2, 3, 5], but it incorrectly returns [2, 3, 5]. Additionally, the function is not designed to dynamically calculate prime numbers; instead, it uses hardcoded values for specific inputs, which limits its functionality and correctness for inputs not explicitly defined in the code.

However, for multiply(148, 412), the unit digits are 8 and 2, and their product is 16, which is also correct. The function fails for the assertion multiply(14, -15) where the unit digits are 4 and 5, and their product should be 20, which is correct. The assertion multiply(76, 67) should return 42, but the unit digits are 6 and 7, and their product is 42, which is correct. The function does not fail any of the tests, but the reasoning behind the expected outputs is not clearly defined in the comments.

For example, for the input (13, 12), it returns -1, which is correct, but for (11, 15), it would also incorrectly return -1 instead of 14.

The correct approach should involve checking the number of 'break points' in the array where the order is disrupted. Specifically, the function should count how many times the order decreases (i.e., arr[i] > arr[i+1]) and ensure that there is at most one such break point for the array to be sortable by right shifts.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case sensitivity correctly, as it converts the entire word to uppercase but does not check for lowercase vowels. The test case 'full' should return 'u' but it is incorrectly expected to return 'U', which indicates a misunderstanding of the case sensitivity requirement. Furthermore, the function fails to return the correct vowel in cases like 'Above', where the expected output is 'o'. Overall, the logic does not align with the function's description."

For example, the test case 'prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])' should return -10, but it incorrectly returns 10 due to the incorrect sign product calculation.

Additionally, the logic for checking the path length and returning the path is flawed. The path should be built based on the original grid values, and the algorithm should ensure that it explores all valid paths of length k while maintaining the lexicographical order.

Additionally, the expected outputs in the assertions include floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 8.0), which do not match the integer outputs of the function.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it will raise an error when trying to reduce an empty list. The correct approach would involve converting the characters back to integers before applying the modulo operation and checking for an empty list before performing the reduction."

For example, in the case of 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed not part of any word since it is separated by a space, and the function correctly returns True. However, in the case of 'apple pi e ', the function incorrectly returns False because it checks for the last character being a space, which is not the intended behavior. The function should instead check if the last character is an alphabetical character and ensure that it is followed by a space or is at the end of the string without any trailing spaces."

For example, the sum of the first 4 positive even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) is 20, but the function would return True for any even number greater than or equal to 8, which is incorrect. The test cases provided also include values like 10, 12, and 16, which should return True, but the function does not correctly validate the condition of being the sum of exactly 4 even numbers."

For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but the current implementation would return '_Example-3' only if it had been implemented correctly.

Additionally, the check for the file extension only verifies the last four characters, which could lead to incorrect results if the file name is longer than four characters and has a valid extension at the end. For example, 'this_is_valid.txt' should return 'Yes', but the implementation would incorrectly return 'No' for names like 'this_is_valid.txtexe'.

For example, the expected result for the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 0.6667 (2/3) and for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] it should be 1.0, which is correct, but the last assertion for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is incorrect as it expects 6.0/5.0 instead of the correct MAD value."
exp_4_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not handle the case where the input list has more than one element correctly. Specifically, when the input list has two or more elements, the function recursively calls itself, which leads to an incorrect result. For example, 'intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)' should return '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]', but the current implementation will return '[2, 2, 2, 2]', which is incorrect because it does not insert the delimiter between the elements correctly. The correct implementation should ensure that the delimiter is added between every two consecutive elements, which is not achieved in the current recursive approach."
exp_4_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group. The use of 'max(len(re.findall(r'\(', s)) - len(re.findall(r'\)', s))' is flawed as it only computes the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses, which does not reflect the actual depth of nesting. Instead, a proper approach would involve iterating through each character in the string and maintaining a counter for the current depth, updating the maximum depth encountered for each group. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_substring' is incorrect because it does not account for the case sensitivity of the substring search. The test cases provided in the 'check' function include strings that may not match due to case differences. For example, if the substring 'run' is searched in 'grunt', it should match, but if the substring were 'RUN', it would not match. The function should either convert both the strings and the substring to the same case (e.g., lower case) before checking for inclusion, or the test cases should be adjusted to ensure they only test for case-sensitive matches."
exp_4_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The use of 'reduce' from the 'functools' module is missing, which will lead to a NameError. Additionally, the product of an empty list should return 1, but the current implementation will raise an error when trying to compute the product of an empty list. The test cases also reveal that the product of the list [100, 0] should return 0, which is correctly handled, but the overall implementation fails for the empty list case."
exp_4_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list of integers. The implementation initializes an empty result list and iterates through the input numbers. For each number, it appends the maximum of the current number and the last appended maximum to the result list. The provided test assertions cover various scenarios, including an empty list, a strictly increasing list, a strictly decreasing list, and a list with varying values. All assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_4_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'is_palindrome' function instead of the 'make_palindrome' function. The assertions provided in the 'check' function do not correspond to the expected outputs of 'is_palindrome', which is supposed to return a boolean indicating whether the input string is a palindrome. Additionally, the implementation of 'make_palindrome' has a logical flaw: it does not correctly append the necessary characters to form the shortest palindrome. For example, 'make_palindrome('jerry')' should return 'jerryyj' instead of 'jerryrrej'. Therefore, the overall implementation is incorrect."
exp_4_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor does not handle cases where the input strings 'a' and 'b' are of different lengths. The test cases provided in the check function assume that both strings are of equal length, but the implementation does not enforce this. If the lengths of 'a' and 'b' differ, it will raise an IndexError when trying to access an index that does not exist in the shorter string. Therefore, the implementation is not robust and fails to meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_4_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the use of 'max' with the key 'len' will return the last occurrence of the longest string instead of the first one. For example, in the test case 'longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])', the expected output is 'yyy' since it is the first string with the maximum length of 3, but the function will return 'zzzz' instead."
exp_4_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function cover a variety of scenarios, including coprime numbers (3 and 7), a common divisor (10 and 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49 and 14), and a case with larger numbers (144 and 60). All assertions in the check function pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_4_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 0 to the length of the string (inclusive), correctly slicing the string to create each prefix. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness for various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements."
exp_4_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The return statement uses ''.join(...) which concatenates the numbers without any delimiter. To fix this, it should use ' '.join(...) to ensure that the numbers are space-delimited as specified in the function's docstring."
exp_4_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly counts distinct characters in a string while ignoring case. The implementation uses 'set' to collect unique characters after converting the string to lowercase, which aligns with the function's description. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness, including edge cases like an empty string and varying cases of characters."
exp_4_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `parse_music` does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical notation. Instead of returning a list of integers based on the notes in the input string, it returns a hardcoded list. The function fails to process the input string and does not account for the different note representations ('o', 'o|', and '.|'). Therefore, the function does not produce the expected output for the provided test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring within the string. The method used (replacing the substring and calculating the length difference) only counts non-overlapping instances. For example, in the case of 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', the expected count is 3 (the overlaps 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the implementation would return 2. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the docstring."
exp_4_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sorting is done lexicographically (alphabetically) rather than numerically based on their values. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted words, which would lead to a concatenated string without spaces."
exp_4_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic only tracks the index of one of the closest elements but does not correctly identify the second closest element. Specifically, it returns 'numbers[min_diff_index]' and 'numbers[min_diff_index + 1]', which does not guarantee that the second number is the closest to the first. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the closest elements are 3.9 and 4.0, but the function would return 3.9 and 5.0 instead. The implementation needs to be revised to correctly identify and return the two closest numbers."
exp_4_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum values are the same. In such cases, the denominator (max_val - min_val) becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. For example, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because it assumes that the function will return [1.0, 0.0] when it should raise an error due to division by zero. Additionally, the expected output for 'assert candidate([2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0])' is incorrect; it should be [0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75] but the order of the inputs does not affect the output as expected. The function needs to be modified to handle cases where all numbers are the same."
exp_4_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance(value, int)' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test cases in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected, returning only the integers from the input lists. All assertions pass, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_4_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function.

exp_4_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' does not correctly implement the requirement to find the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n'. The loop starts from 'n' and checks for divisibility, but it returns 'n' itself when 'i' equals 'n', which violates the requirement of being smaller than 'n'. For example, calling 'largest_divisor(3)' should return 1, but the current implementation would return 3. The test cases in the 'check' function expect the correct behavior, but the implementation fails to meet this requirement."
exp_4_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'factorize' does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. The inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect results, especially for composite numbers. For example, when testing with 70, the expected output is [2, 5, 7], but the function will return [2, 5, 7] only if it finds the factors in that order. However, the implementation does not handle cases where multiple factors exist correctly, as it may skip over potential factors. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where a prime factor appears multiple times. The test cases provided in the 'check' function may pass for some inputs, but they will fail for others, indicating that the implementation is not robust."
exp_4_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation incorrectly retains elements that appear only once. The test case candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) is expected to return [1, 4, 5], which is correct, but the implementation fails to handle the case where elements are duplicated correctly. The logic used in the list comprehension does not account for the requirement to remove all duplicates, leading to incorrect results."
exp_4_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'swapcase()' effectively changes lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')) is expected to return ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA']. The implementation is correct, but the assertion in the test case is incorrect as it does not account for the fact that 'xxx' appears multiple times in the input list, and thus should only be included once in the output list."
exp_4_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function get_positive correctly implements the logic to filter out only positive numbers from the input list. The test assertions provided in the check function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various cases, including lists with negative numbers, a mix of positive and negative numbers, an empty list, and a list with only negative numbers. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_4_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for primality. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so we only need to check for factors up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for even numbers greater than 2 correctly, as it will return True for all even numbers greater than 2. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs, such as 4 and other even numbers."
exp_4_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The logic used to find the zero of the polynomial does not guarantee convergence to a root. The method used (Newton's method-like approach) is not properly defined, as it does not account for cases where the derivative (computed by the 'poly' function) could be zero, leading to division by zero errors. Additionally, the polynomial evaluation in the 'poly' function incorrectly uses 'xs[1]' twice in the polynomial expansion, which should be 'xs[2]' for the second term. This will lead to incorrect evaluations of the polynomial, affecting the root-finding process."
exp_4_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it attempts to sort the individual elements (which are integers) at those indices, resulting in an error. The correct approach should involve collecting the values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back into the new list at the appropriate indices while keeping the other values unchanged."
exp_4_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list.

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], but it incorrectly expects the result to be 124 instead of 124. Therefore, the test case fails, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation of the function."
exp_4_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' in those numbers. The test cases provided in the check function suggest that the expected outputs are based on the correct counting of '7's in the specified range, but the implementation does not correctly account for all numbers divisible by 11 or 13. For example, the number 77 (which is divisible by both 11 and 13) should contribute to the count, but the implementation does not correctly handle the counting logic for all relevant numbers. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for all test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly maintain the values at odd indices while sorting the values at even indices. The implementation concatenates the sorted even-indexed values with the odd-indexed values, which results in incorrect placements. For example, in the second test case, the expected output is [-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123], but the function returns [-12, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 11, 23, -10], which is incorrect. The odd-indexed values should remain in their original positions."
exp_4_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is incorrectly testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it is currently checking 'encode_cyclic(encoded_str)', which does not make sense. Therefore, the test will fail, and the implementation cannot be considered correct."
exp_4_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_fib' is expected to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation only returns the first two prime Fibonacci numbers (2 and 3) for n = 1 and n = 2, and for n >= 3, it incorrectly calls a function 'fibonacci(n)' which is not defined in the provided code. This will lead to an error when n is greater than 2. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime, so the logic to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number is not implemented correctly."
exp_4_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is not implemented correctly. It currently always returns False, which does not fulfill the requirement of checking for three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

exp_4_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it only contains a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any calculations or return any values. The expected output for the number of collisions, as indicated by the test assertions, suggests that the function should return n * n (the square of n), since each car moving left to right can collide with each car moving right to left. However, without an implementation, the function cannot produce any output, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect."

The expected output for this input should be [4, 3, 2], which is correct, but the assertion is misleading as it suggests the output is incorrect. Therefore, the overall correctness of the implementation is compromised by the incorrect test assertion."
exp_4_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it does not properly check for pairs that sum to zero. The recursive approach used in the code is flawed; it only checks pairs in a limited manner and does not consider all distinct pairs in the list. For example, in the case of the input [-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30], the function fails to find the pair (-3, 3) that sums to zero. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the list has more than two elements correctly, as it only checks the first element against the rest of the list recursively without considering all combinations.

Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(234, 2) == ""11101010""' is also incorrect; the correct binary representation of 234 is '11101010', which is correct, but the function does not handle the case of converting 9 to base 3 correctly.

The test cases also reveal this issue, as the assertion 'assert not candidate([1, 8, 4, 10], 10)' should return False, but the function would return True instead."

However, it fails for other cases such as [3, 2, 1] which should return [6, 2] but returns [2, 2]. Additionally, the case [3, 2, 1, 0, 4] should return [12, 6, 0, 0] but returns [2, 2, 0, 16]. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly handle all cases."

The base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2 return the expected values. The recursive case correctly computes the n-th FibFib number by summing the values of fibfib(n-1), fibfib(n-2), and fibfib(n-3). The provided test assertions in the check function also confirm that the implementation produces the correct outputs for the specified inputs."

The current implementation counts 'y' as a vowel regardless of its position. For example, 'key' should return 1 (not 2) because 'y' is at the end, but 'bye' should return 1 as well. Additionally, the function does not account for uppercase vowels, which means 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' should also be included in the count. The test cases provided do not cover all necessary scenarios, such as words with mixed case or words where 'y' is not at the end."

According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the string when the shift is greater than the length of the string, which is correct. The issue arises with the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""', which expects the output to be '001', but the function will return '00' instead. This is because the function does not pad the result with leading zeros. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."

The code assumes that the number of oranges is always at the same index (2) in the split string, which is not guaranteed. For example, in the test case '1 apples and 100 oranges', the number of oranges would be at index 4 after splitting, leading to an incorrect calculation. The function should be modified to correctly extract the number of oranges regardless of its position in the string."
exp_4_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly return the expected output. While it correctly identifies even values and their indices, the final return statement does not return the required format of [smallest_value, its index]. Instead, it returns only the first element of the sorted list, which is a list itself. The correct return should be a list containing the smallest even value and its index, not just the smallest even value. For example, the return statement should be 'return [sorted_even_values[0][0], sorted_even_values[0][1]]' instead of 'return sorted(even_values, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]'."

However, it returns the first valid integer found, which may not be the greatest one. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1, but the function returns 5, which is incorrect. The function needs to check all integers and keep track of the maximum valid integer before returning it."
exp_4_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly achieve the desired 'strange sorting' as described in the comments. The current implementation uses 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x%2)', which sorts the list based on whether the numbers are even or odd, rather than following the specified pattern of alternating between the minimum and maximum remaining values. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, such as 'strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])' returning [1, 2, 3, 4] instead of the expected [1, 4, 2, 3]. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the function description."

Additionally, the expected area values in the test cases do not match the results produced by the current implementation, indicating that the function does not return the correct area for valid triangles."

According to the function description, if the two lists have the same number of characters, it should return the first list. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' fails because the total character count for both lists is the same (8 characters each), but the function does not account for the case where the second list has a different composition of strings. The function should return the first list in this case, but it does not, leading to incorrect behavior."

The current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as a product of two prime factors, which is insufficient. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the product of three primes is required. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate(8) == True' is incorrect because 8 is not the product of three primes (it is 2 * 2 * 2). Furthermore, the assertion 'assert candidate(125) == True' is also incorrect as 125 is not the product of three primes (it is 5 * 5 * 5). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

The expression 'n ** int(math.log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to the way integer conversion is handled. For example, when 'x' is not an exact power of 'n', the logarithm may not yield an integer, leading to incorrect comparisons. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True' is incorrect because 9 is indeed 3 squared, but the implementation may not handle it correctly due to the integer conversion issue. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_4_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The function iscube(a) checks if a is a perfect cube by comparing a**(1/3) to int(a**(1/3)). However, this method can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. For example, while checking for perfect cubes, the result of a**(1/3) might not be exactly equal to int(a**(1/3)) due to rounding errors. This can cause the function to return False for some perfect cubes, such as 1728, which is a perfect cube (12^3) but would fail the test because of the precision issue. A more reliable approach would be to round the cube root and then cube it back to check if it equals the original number."

The function also does not count the prime hexadecimal digits as specified in the task description. The checks for hexadecimal validity are incorrect and excessive, and the actual counting logic for prime digits (2, 3, 5, 7, B, D) is missing entirely. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."

For example, the string 'abc' would pass the current check, but it should be evaluated for distinctness of every triplet, such as 'abc', 'bca', etc. The correct implementation should check if s[i], s[i + 1], and s[i + 2] are all different. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The grading logic incorrectly assigns 'D+' to any GPA greater than or equal to 1.0, which is not in line with the specified grading criteria. The correct output for a GPA of 1.2 should be 'D-', not 'D+'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' is incorrect as it should expect 'D-'. Therefore, the function fails to produce the correct letter grades for certain GPA inputs."

Specifically, it returns True for a string of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the logic used to check for prime numbers is flawed; it should check for factors up to the square root of the length of the string, rather than up to the length itself. This leads to incorrect results for strings of certain lengths, such as 'M' (length 1) and 'HI' (length 2). The assertions in the test cases reveal these issues, as some expected results do not match the actual output of the function."

However, the implementation counts incorrectly due to the way it checks each number in the range. The correct approach should consider the total counts of n-digit numbers starting with 1 and those ending with 1, while avoiding double counting the numbers that both start and end with 1."

However, for N = 150, the sum of the digits is 6, and the expected output is '110', but the function would return '10010110', which is the binary representation of 150.

The test cases provided in the 'check' function also do not align with the intended functionality, as they expect results based on the incorrect implementation. For example, 'add([4, 88])' should return 0 since there are no even elements at odd indices, but it returns 88 due to summing the element at index 1 instead."

The requirement states that the sorting should be based on the sum of the first and last elements of the array, but the code incorrectly checks if the sum of all elements is even or odd. This leads to incorrect sorting behavior for certain test cases, such as 'sort_array([21, 14, 23, 11])', which should return [23, 21, 14, 11] but will not due to the incorrect condition."

However, it does not account for characters outside the lowercase alphabet (e.g., uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters), which would lead to incorrect results for such inputs. Additionally, the test cases provided do not cover these edge cases, which could lead to further issues in real-world usage. Therefore, the implementation is not robust and does not meet the requirements as described."

Additionally, the case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -35 as the second smallest element, but the implementation does not account for the correct ordering of negative numbers.

Additionally, the type checks for integers are only applied when 'x' is being compared to the sum of 'y' and 'z', which means that if 'y' or 'z' are integers but 'x' is not, the function could incorrectly return True.

The problem statement specifies that the input should be an array of non-negative integers, but the test cases include negative integers. The expected outputs in the test cases do not match the actual outputs produced by the function. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]) == [-4, -2, -6, -5, -3]' is incorrect because the function does not account for negative numbers, and the expected output does not follow the sorting criteria based on the number of ones in their binary representation. Additionally, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is also incorrect as the actual output from the function would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which is correct, but the assertion in the test cases is wrong.

Firstly, the function does not correctly identify the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. The logic used to check for vowels and consonants is flawed. For example, in the case of 'FULL', the function returns 'u' instead of 'U', which is incorrect as it should be case-sensitive. Additionally, the loop that checks for vowels does not correctly iterate through the string to find the closest vowel between two consonants. The test cases also reveal that the function fails to return the expected results for several inputs, such as 'easy' and 'eAsy', which should return an empty string but do not. Overall, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, in the case of [4, -4, 4] with k = 2, the output is [4, 4], which is correct, but the function fails to sort the k elements in other cases.

The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the product by 1 for positive numbers and -1 for negative numbers without considering the count of negative numbers. This leads to incorrect results for test cases such as 'prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])' which should return -10 but does not due to the flawed logic in sign calculation."

The correct approach should involve iterating through the list to find the largest negative and smallest positive integers directly, rather than relying on sorting. This leads to incorrect results for several test cases, such as when there are multiple negative integers or when the smallest positive integer is not the first element in the sorted list."

The correct logic should ensure that if the total eaten (number + remaining) is less than the need, it should return the total eaten as 'number + remaining' and the remaining carrots as 0, indicating the rabbit is still hungry.

exp_5_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly for the product. The 'reduce' function is used with an initial value of 1, which is correct for the product of non-empty lists, but when the input list is empty, it should return 1 as specified in the function's docstring. However, the current implementation will raise a TypeError when trying to reduce an empty list without an initial value. The correct implementation should check if the list is empty and return (0, 1) directly in that case."
exp_5_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It iterates through the list and appends the maximum value found up to each index. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various scenarios, including an empty list, an increasing sequence, a decreasing sequence, and a mixed sequence. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_5_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' is correctly implemented and works as intended. However, the function 'make_palindrome' has a logical flaw. The algorithm does not correctly append the necessary characters to create the shortest palindrome. For example, the test case 'jerry' should return 'jerryrrej', but the implementation will not produce this result due to an incorrect handling of the palindromic suffix. The loop logic does not correctly identify the longest palindromic prefix and append the correct characters to form the shortest palindrome."
exp_5_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. For example, if 'a' is '010' and 'b' is '110', the function will only compare the first three characters, which is correct. But if the lengths differ, it will not yield the expected result. The test case candidate('111000', '101010') is expected to return '010010', but the function will throw an error if the lengths are not equal. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the longest function does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the max function will return the last occurrence of the maximum length string instead of the first one. For example, in the test case longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']), 'zzzz' is returned, but 'yyy' is the first string with the maximum length of 4. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function cover various scenarios, including coprime numbers (3 and 7), a common divisor (10 and 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49 and 14), and a case with larger numbers (144 and 60). All assertions in the check function pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_5_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,INCORRECT,"The function all_prefixes is expected to return all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. However, the implementation returns an extra prefix, which is the empty string. The correct output for an empty input string should be an empty list, but the implementation includes the empty string as the first prefix. Therefore, the assertion for the empty string fails, leading to an incorrect implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The correct implementation should return a string with space-delimited numbers, but the current implementation uses ''.join() without a space separator, resulting in a concatenated string without spaces. For example, calling string_sequence(5) should return '0 1 2 3 4 5', but it currently returns '012345'."
exp_5_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters is intended to count distinct characters in a string regardless of case. However, the test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' should return 6 distinct characters ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') but it returns 5, indicating that the implementation does not correctly account for all distinct characters when they appear in different cases. The implementation is correct for other test cases, but this specific case reveals a flaw in handling character uniqueness."
exp_5_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical note legend. Instead of dynamically generating a list of integers based on the input string, it returns a hardcoded list. This means that it will not produce the expected results for varying inputs, as demonstrated by the test assertions. The function needs to iterate through the input string, identify the notes based on the legend, and return the corresponding list of beats."
exp_5_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring within the string. The current approach calculates the difference in length between the original string and the string after removing all occurrences of the substring. This method fails to account for overlapping cases, such as in the example 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', where the correct count should be 3 (the occurrences are at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3). A correct implementation would involve iterating through the string and checking for the substring at each position, allowing for overlaps."
exp_5_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the numbers represented as words. The sort method sorts the strings lexicographically (alphabetically), which does not correspond to their numerical values. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which results in the output being concatenated without spaces. The function needs to map the words to their corresponding numerical values, sort them based on those values, and then convert them back to words before returning the result."
exp_5_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic used to find the closest pair only tracks the index of one of the closest numbers, but it does not correctly identify the second number. Specifically, it always returns the number at 'min_diff_index + 1', which may not be the closest number to the one at 'min_diff_index'. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the closest numbers are 3.9 and 4.0, but the function would return (3.9, 4.0) correctly in this case. However, in other cases, such as 'find_closest_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1])', it would return (2.2, 3.1) which is incorrect as 2.2 and 3.1 are not the closest pair. The function needs to store both numbers that are closest, not just one index."
exp_5_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is correct for the provided test cases, except for the second test case in the 'check' function. The assertion 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [1.0, 0.0] based on the linear transformation, but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] as expected. However, the order of the output is reversed, which is not consistent with the requirement that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. Therefore, the implementation does not handle cases where the input list is not sorted correctly, leading to incorrect results for some inputs."
exp_5_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension combined with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they cover various scenarios including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_5_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, and they all pass successfully. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_5_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' does not correctly implement the logic to find the largest divisor smaller than n. The loop starts from n and checks for divisibility, but it returns n itself when i equals n, which violates the requirement to find a divisor smaller than n. For example, calling largest_divisor(3) should return 1, but the current implementation would return 3 instead. The function needs to start checking from n-1 down to 1 to find the largest divisor smaller than n."
exp_5_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `factorize` function does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect factorization when n is divisible by a prime factor greater than 2. For example, when n is 70, the function will first find 2, then reduce n to 35, and then it will find 5, but it will not find 7 correctly because the outer loop continues with n = 7 and will not find any factors. This results in missing factors in the output. The function should instead iterate only up to the square root of n and handle the remaining n if it is greater than 1 after the loop. Additionally, the test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, such as prime numbers greater than 2 or composite numbers with multiple prime factors."
exp_5_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each unique element. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4] because 2 occurs more than once and should be removed entirely. The implementation does not achieve this, as it retains the first occurrence of 2. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirement."
exp_5_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'char.swapcase()' effectively converts lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function meets the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'concatenate' function correctly concatenates a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function confirm that the function behaves as expected for both an empty list and a list with multiple strings. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test assertion check(candidate) fails because the expected output for the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] with prefix 'xxx' is incorrectly specified. The correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list. The assertion does not account for duplicate entries in the output."
exp_5_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function get_positive correctly filters out only the positive numbers from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through the list and includes only those elements that are greater than zero. The provided test assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with negative numbers, a mix of positive and negative numbers, an empty list, and a list with only negative numbers. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_5_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for prime numbers. The loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. It should only check up to the square root of n for factors. This inefficiency can lead to performance issues for larger numbers. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of even numbers greater than 2 correctly, as it will return True for them, which is incorrect. Therefore, the function fails to pass the assertions correctly for all cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The logic used to find the zero of the polynomial does not correctly apply any root-finding algorithm. Instead, it simply computes a value based on the coefficients, which does not guarantee that poly(x) = 0. The test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the correctness of a root-finding function, but they are incorrectly checking against the 'poly' function instead of 'find_zero'. Therefore, the code does not fulfill the requirements of finding a zero of the polynomial."
exp_5_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' is incorrect because it does not sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead, it appends the original value at those indices and attempts to sort the value at non-divisible indices, which is not the intended behavior. The expected behavior is to collect the values at indices divisible by three, sort them, and then replace the original values at those indices in the output list. The test cases provided in the assertions also indicate that the output does not match the expected results."
exp_5_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from a list.

exp_5_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function max_element is correct, but the test case in the check function contains an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum value in the list is actually 124, but the original function's docstring example shows a different list with 123 as the maximum. Therefore, the test case does not match the expected output of the function as described in the docstring."
exp_5_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' correctly. The test assertions provided in the check function indicate that the expected results for inputs like 100, 200, 4000, and 10000 do not match the actual outputs of the function, suggesting that the logic for counting occurrences of '7' is not correctly aligned with the expected results. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function sort_even is intended to sort the values at even indices of the input list while leaving the values at odd indices unchanged. However, the implementation incorrectly sorts both even and odd indexed values, and then reverses them before combining. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases. For example, the expected output for the input [5, 6, 3, 4] is [3, 6, 5, 4], but the function will not produce this result due to the incorrect handling of odd indexed values."
exp_5_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it incorrectly checks 'encode_cyclic' instead. This leads to a failure in validating the decoding process. Additionally, the logic in both encoding and decoding functions is identical, which is incorrect. The decoding function should reverse the encoding operation, but it currently performs the same operation as encoding."

The implementation only handles the first two cases (n = 1 and n = 2) correctly, returning 2 and 3 respectively. For n >= 3, it calls a function 'fibonacci(n)', which is not defined in the provided code. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime.

However, the test assertions in the check function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the correctness of the implementation is incorrect due to the flawed test case."

This does not accommodate bases other than 2, which is a requirement based on the function's description. Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(9, 3) == ""100""' fails because the correct representation of 9 in base 3 is '100', but the function does not handle this conversion correctly.

The function sorts the even values and returns the first one, which is correct for finding the smallest even value, but it does not ensure that the index of that value is the smallest among those with the same value. For example, in the case of 'candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])', the function would return [0, 3] instead of the expected [0, 1], as it does not account for the index of the first occurrence of the smallest even value. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_5_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'search' does not correctly identify the greatest integer that meets the specified conditions. Specifically, the logic used to check the frequency of integers is flawed. The function only checks for the first occurrence of an integer that meets the frequency condition and returns it immediately, which may not be the greatest integer that satisfies the condition. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4])', the expected result is -1, but the function would return 4 because it checks the first integer that meets the condition without considering all integers in the list. Additionally, the sorting of the list is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the correct result. A more comprehensive approach is needed to evaluate all integers and their frequencies before determining the maximum valid integer."

The sorting key used in 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x, -x))' does not alternate between the minimum and maximum values as required. Instead, it sorts the list in a way that does not reflect the specified pattern. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4] should yield [1, 4, 2, 3], but the current implementation would not produce this result. The test cases provided in the 'check' function reveal that the output does not match the expected results for several cases, indicating that the sorting logic is flawed."
exp_5_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `triangle_area` does not correctly calculate the area of a triangle. The area of a triangle given its sides can be calculated using Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). The current implementation incorrectly uses the formula (a * b * c) ** (1/2), which does not yield the correct area. Additionally, the expected area for the test case `triangle_area(1, 1, 1)` is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the area calculated using Heron's formula would be sqrt(0.5 * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5)) = 0.433, which rounds to 0.43. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' fails because the total character count for both lists is equal (9 characters each). According to the function's description, in such cases, the first list should be returned, but the current implementation returns the second list instead. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where both lists have the same total character count."

The current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as a product of two prime factors, which is insufficient. Additionally, the function does not account for the requirement that the product must specifically involve three prime numbers. For example, the test case is_multiply_prime(8) should return False, as 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, which involves only one prime number. Furthermore, the test case is_multiply_prime(125) should return False, as 125 = 5 * 5 * 5, again involving only one prime number. The logic needs to be revised to ensure it checks for exactly three distinct prime factors."
exp_5_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The function `is_simple_power` is intended to determine if `x` is a simple power of `n`, meaning that there exists an integer `k` such that `n**k = x`. The implementation uses `math.log(x, n)` to find `k`, but it does not correctly handle cases where `x` is not an exact power of `n`. Specifically, the use of `int(math.log(x, n))` can lead to incorrect results due to flooring the logarithm, which may not yield the correct exponent if `x` is not a perfect power of `n`. For example, `is_simple_power(9, 3)` should return `True`, but it would return `False` because `int(math.log(9, 3))` evaluates to `2`, and `3**2` is `9`, which is correct. However, the function fails for other cases like `is_simple_power(24, 2)`, which should return `False`, but the logic does not account for the fact that `n` must be greater than `1` and `x` must be a non-negative integer. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that the function fails to satisfy, indicating that the implementation is not robust enough to handle all scenarios."

The expression 'a**(1/3) % 1 == 0' checks if the cube root of 'a' is an integer, but due to floating-point precision issues, this can yield incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the test checks 'candidate(1728)', which is not the same. Additionally, negative numbers should be handled correctly, but the current implementation may not accurately reflect this due to the same floating-point issues."

The correct prime hexadecimal digits to count are '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B' (11 in decimal), and 'D' (13 in decimal). Therefore, the function will return incorrect counts for inputs that contain 'D' or 'E'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is invalid since the input should be a string, not a list.

The current check only verifies if all three letters are the same, but it does not account for cases where the three letters are different. For example, the string 'abc' would be considered happy, but the implementation would not correctly validate this since it only checks for equality. The correct logic should ensure that s[i], s[i + 1], and s[i + 2] are all distinct. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Specifically, the condition for GPA 1.2 should return 'D-' instead of 'D+' as it falls between 1.0 and 1.3. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' is incorrect; it should be 'D-' based on the grading criteria. Therefore, the implementation fails to produce the correct letter grades for certain GPA values."
exp_5_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function incorrectly determines whether the length of a string is prime. Specifically, it returns True for strings of length 1, which is not a prime number. Additionally, it returns False for strings of length 2, which is a prime number. The logic for checking primality is also flawed; it should check divisibility only up to the square root of the length, and it should return True for lengths that are prime. The test cases reveal these issues, as some assertions fail due to the incorrect implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' is not correctly calculating the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The current implementation iterates through all n-digit integers and checks each one, which is inefficient and may lead to performance issues for larger n. Additionally, the expected results in the test assertions are incorrect. For n=2, the correct count should be 19 (10-19, 21-29, 31-39, ..., 91-99, plus 11), not 18. For n=3, it should be 198, not 180, and so on. The logic for counting should be based on combinatorial reasoning rather than brute force checking each number."

Similarly, for N = 150, the sum of the digits is 6, which should return '110', but the function returns '10010110' (the binary representation of 150). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

As a result, the output does not match the expected behavior described in the function's docstring and the provided test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates of the rows by columns in descending order. After the first sorting by rows, the second sorting is done incorrectly. The line 'result.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])' sorts the coordinates by the column index in ascending order instead of descending. This leads to incorrect output for cases where multiple occurrences of 'x' exist in the same row. For example, in the test case with input [[1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,4,1,6], [1,2,3,4,5,1]], the expected output is not achieved due to this sorting issue."

Instead of checking the sum of the first and last elements (array[0] + array[-1]), it incorrectly checks the sum of all elements in the array (sum(array)). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior for certain inputs. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of all elements is even, so it sorts in descending order, which is correct, but for an input like [1, 2, 3], the sum of the first and last elements (1 + 3 = 4) is even, and it would sort in descending order instead of ascending as required. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

The comments state that the letters should shift down by 'two multiplied to two places', which implies a shift of 4 positions. However, the code currently shifts each character by only 2 positions. For example, 'a' should become 'e' (not 'c'), and 'h' should become 'l' (not 'j'). Therefore, the test cases that expect a shift of 4 will fail, leading to incorrect outputs."

The current implementation sums all the first k elements without checking if they have at most two digits. Additionally, the function is overly complicated with repetitive code for each value of k, which could be simplified using a loop or list comprehension. The test cases also reveal that the function does not return the expected results for certain inputs, indicating that the logic is flawed."

However, the assertion for candidate(12) is incorrect as the odd numbers from the Collatz sequence for 12 are [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and the assertions are not entirely accurate."
exp_5_HumanEval/124,HumanEval/124,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `valid_date` does not correctly validate the number of days for each month and does not account for leap years. Specifically, it incorrectly checks the number of days for February (it allows up to 31 days) and does not differentiate between months with 30 and 31 days. Additionally, the year is not validated at all. The test cases that involve invalid dates based on the number of days in a month (like '04-31-3000' and '03-32-2011') would not be handled correctly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/125,HumanEval/125,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'split_words' contains a logical error in the first conditional check. The condition 'if '' in txt:' is always true because an empty string is considered to be present in any string. This means that the function will always attempt to split the input string on whitespace, regardless of whether any whitespace exists. Additionally, the function does not correctly count the number of lowercase letters in odd positions in the alphabet when neither whitespace nor commas are present. The correct implementation should check for whitespace and commas properly and count lowercase letters based on their positions in the alphabet."

The current implementation only checks if the list is sorted, without considering the number of duplicates. For example, is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) should return False according to the requirements, but it currently returns True because the list is sorted. Additionally, is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]) should also return False, but it currently returns True as well. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified criteria."

The function only checks if the intervals intersect and returns 'YES' if they do, without calculating the intersection length or checking for primality. For example, the intersection of (1, 2) and (2, 3) should yield a length of 0 (not prime), but the function incorrectly returns 'YES'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the intervals are the same, which should also return 'NO' as the length of the intersection is 0. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail."

The function is supposed to return the sum of the magnitudes of integers multiplied by the product of their signs. However, the current implementation only calculates the product of the signs and does not compute the sum of the magnitudes. For example, for the input [1, 2, 2, -4], the expected output is -9, but the function will return -1 (the product of signs) instead of the correct value. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include assertions that will fail due to this incorrect implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/129,HumanEval/129,False,INCORRECT,"The provided implementation of the function 'minPath' is incomplete and does not contain any logic to compute the minimum path of length k in the grid. The comments suggest a complex dynamic programming approach, but there is no actual code to perform the necessary calculations or return the required output. Therefore, it cannot produce the expected results as indicated in the test assertions."

Specifically, the recurrence relation for odd 'n' is incorrectly implemented. The function does not account for the correct calculation of 'tri(n)' for odd values, leading to incorrect results in the assertions. For example, 'tri(3)' should compute 'tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)', but the current implementation does not perform this calculation correctly. Additionally, the expected outputs in the assertions contain floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 8.0) which are not consistent with the expected integer outputs based on the provided sequence definition."

The expression 'i % 2 != 0' is applied to 'i', which is a string (character) representing a digit, rather than an integer. This will raise a TypeError when trying to perform the modulus operation. Additionally, the 'reduce' function is not imported, which will also cause a NameError. The function does not handle the case where all digits are even correctly, as it will return the product of the odd digits instead of 0. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_nested' incorrectly determines whether a string of brackets contains a valid nested subsequence. The current implementation only checks if the counts of '[' and ']' are equal, returning False if they are. This does not accurately assess nesting, as valid nested brackets can exist even if the counts are equal. For example, the input '[]' has equal counts but is not nested, while '[[]]' is nested but also has equal counts. The function fails to account for the actual structure of the brackets, leading to incorrect results for various test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' correctly computes the sum of the squares of the ceiling values of the elements in the input list.

The condition 'txt[-1] not in txt[:-1]' is intended to check if the last character is not part of any word, but it fails for cases where the last character is a letter followed by spaces. For example, in the case of 'apple pi e ', the last character is 'e', which is indeed part of a word, but the function incorrectly returns True. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/135,HumanEval/135,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'can_arrange' is not implemented, as it contains only a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any operations or return any values, which means it cannot produce the expected results for the test assertions provided in the 'check' function. Without a proper implementation, the function cannot fulfill the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. Specifically, the logic for finding the largest negative integer is flawed because it only updates 'a' if it finds a negative integer that is greater than the current value of 'a', which is not the intended behavior. The expected behavior is to find the largest negative integer, which should be the least negative (closest to zero). For example, in the case of [-1, -3, -5, -6], the function returns -1, which is correct, but in cases where there are multiple negative integers, it may not return the correct largest negative integer. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no positive integers correctly, as it should return None for 'b' in such cases. The test cases provided also indicate that the function fails to return the expected results for certain inputs."
exp_5_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle string representations of numbers correctly, especially when they contain commas or periods. For example, '2,3' should be interpreted as 2.3, but the current implementation compares the strings directly, which will not yield the correct numerical comparison. Additionally, the function does not convert strings to floats or integers before comparison, which is necessary to fulfill the requirements stated in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_equal_to_sum_even incorrectly calculates whether a number can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. The current implementation checks if n is equal to the sum of all even numbers up to n, which is not the correct logic. For example, the sum of the first four positive even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) is 20, and the function would return False for any n less than 20, even though numbers like 8, 10, and 12 can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers (e.g., 2+2+2+2, 2+2+2+4, 2+2+4+4 respectively). The test cases also indicate that the function does not handle all cases correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' does not correctly compute the Brazilian factorial as defined in the comments. The current implementation recursively multiplies 'n' by the result of 'special_factorial(n-1)', which computes the standard factorial (n!) instead of the Brazilian factorial (n! * (n-1)! * ... * 1!). The correct approach would involve calculating the factorial for each integer from n down to 1 and multiplying them together. Therefore, the test assertions will fail for inputs greater than 1."

The current implementation replaces all spaces with underscores first and then attempts to replace underscores with hyphens, which does not achieve the desired behavior. For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but the current implementation will not produce this result correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'file_name_check' does not correctly enforce the requirement of having no more than three digits in the file name. The first condition checks if the length of the file name is greater than 3, which is not the same as checking for the number of digits. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the substring before the dot is empty, as it only checks if the first character is a letter. The implementation also fails to check if the substring after the dot is valid when there are no digits in the file name. Therefore, the function does not meet all the specified conditions for a valid file name."
exp_5_HumanEval/142,HumanEval/142,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the comments. Specifically, the code squares the integer at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 3, but it does not correctly cube the integer at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The current implementation will square the integer at index 0 (which is a multiple of 3) and will also square any integer at indices that are multiples of 3, regardless of whether they are also multiples of 4. This leads to incorrect results for test cases where both conditions apply. For example, the test case '[-56,-99,1,0,-2]' should return 3030, but the current implementation will not produce the correct output due to the flawed logic."
exp_5_HumanEval/143,HumanEval/143,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify words with prime lengths. The implementation lacks the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is crucial for determining if a word's length is prime. Without this function, the filter will not work as intended, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the output for the test case 'here' should be an empty string, which is correct, but the other assertions may fail due to the missing prime-checking logic."
exp_5_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly evaluate whether the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality of cross products, which is not the correct approach to determine if the product of the fractions is a whole number. Instead, the function should check if (x_num * n_num) is divisible by (x_den * n_den). This means that the product of the numerators should be divisible by the product of the denominators for the result to be a whole number. As a result, the function will fail for some test cases, such as 'simplify(""1/5"", ""1/5"")', which should return True but will return False due to the incorrect logic."
exp_5_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'order_by_points' is not implemented, which means it cannot produce any output or fulfill the requirements stated in the docstring.

Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail, leading to incorrect behavior."
exp_5_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' does not correctly check the first digit of the number. The condition '(num // 10) % 2 == 1' only checks the second digit for oddness, not the first digit. For example, the number 21 would pass the check incorrectly since its first digit (2) is even. The correct approach would involve extracting the first digit properly, which can be done by converting the number to a string or using a loop to divide by 10 until the first digit is found."
exp_5_HumanEval/147,HumanEval/147,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation does not correctly follow the problem requirements. The function is supposed to count the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) such that their sum is a multiple of 3, but the code only counts pairs (a[i], a[j]) whose sum is a multiple of 3. Additionally, the array 'a' is incorrectly initialized as a list of integers from 1 to n instead of using the formula a[i] = i * i - i + 1. This leads to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/148,HumanEval/148,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'bf' does not correctly implement the logic to find planets between the two given planets. The slicing operation 'planets[planet1:planet2]' is incorrect because it assumes 'planets' is a list or similar structure that supports slicing by planet names, which it is not. Instead, 'planets' should be a list of planet names in order, and the function should find the indices of 'planet1' and 'planet2' to correctly slice the list. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where 'planet1' is after 'planet2' in the list, which could lead to incorrect results or an empty tuple when it should return the planets in between. The test cases also include a case where the order of planets is reversed, which the current implementation does not handle."
exp_5_HumanEval/150,HumanEval/150,False,INCORRECT,"The function x_or_y is supposed to return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. However, the implementation incorrectly checks if n is even (n % 2 == 0) to determine the return value. This logic does not correctly identify prime numbers, as many prime numbers (e.g., 3, 5, 7) are odd, and the number 2 is the only even prime. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct values for prime numbers and non-prime numbers, leading to incorrect results for the provided test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/151,HumanEval/151,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'double_the_difference' does not correctly handle the requirements specified in the docstring. The function is supposed to return the sum of squares of odd integers only, while ignoring negative numbers and non-integers. However, the list comprehension used in the function only checks if a number is odd (i%2==1) and does not filter out negative numbers or non-integers. As a result, the function will incorrectly include negative odd numbers in the calculation. For example, the test case 'double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0])' should return 0, but the current implementation will not handle this correctly. Additionally, the test case 'double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5])' is expected to return 34, but the function will not correctly process the non-integer 0.2, leading to incorrect results."

The function currently returns the absolute difference for each index, but it does not account for the case where the guess is correct (i.e., the difference should be 0). The expected output for the test cases indicates that if the guess matches the score, the result should be 0, which is not handled correctly in the code. For example, in the test case compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]), the expected output is [0,0,0,0,3,3], but the function would return [0,0,0,0,3,3] as expected. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where the guess is negative or does not match the score correctly. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The strength should be calculated as CAP - SM, where CAP is the count of uppercase letters and SM is the count of lowercase letters. However, the current implementation only counts uppercase letters as positive and lowercase letters as negative, without properly tracking the counts of uppercase and lowercase letters separately. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are multiple extensions with the same strength correctly, as it only updates the strongest extension when a strictly greater strength is found, ignoring the case of ties. This leads to incorrect results for some test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/155,HumanEval/155,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case of negative numbers and the digit '0'. When the input is negative, the '-' sign is included in the string representation of the number, which causes the function to attempt to convert it to an integer, leading to an error. Additionally, the digit '0' should be counted as an even digit, but the function does not account for it correctly in the assertions. For example, the assertion for 'check(candidate(0))' is correct, but the function does not explicitly handle the case of '0' in the loop. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."

Specifically, when 'number + need' exceeds 'remaining', the function returns '[remaining, 0]', which is correct for the total eaten carrots but does not account for the fact that the rabbit is still hungry. The correct total should be 'number + remaining' instead of just 'remaining'. For example, in the case of 'eat(2, 11, 5)', the rabbit has eaten 2 carrots and needs 11, but can only eat 5 remaining carrots, so the total eaten should be 2 + 5 = 7, and the remaining should be 0.

For example, in the case of the input ['**', '*', '+'] and [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is 2 ** 3 * 4 + 5, which evaluates to 37. However, the current implementation will not yield the correct result due to the lack of proper handling of operator precedence. Additionally, the implementation does not correctly initialize the result for operations like multiplication and division, which can lead to incorrect results when the first operand is not 0. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Additionally, the recursive call does not ensure that only even numbers are included in the result. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 14)' should return an empty list, but the logic does not account for the range correctly. The test cases also include assertions that are not valid based on the function's intended behavior, such as 'assert candidate(10, 2) == [2, 4, 6, 8]', which should not return those values since there are no even numbers between 10 and 2."

Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

Therefore, the test case for an empty string fails, leading to an incorrect implementation."

The method used (subtracting the length of the modified string from the original string) only counts non-overlapping occurrences. For example, in the case of 'aaaa' and 'aa', the expected count is 3 (for 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the current implementation would return 2. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1])', the closest elements are 2.2 and 3.1, which is also correctly returned. The issue arises because the function only checks adjacent elements, which can lead to missing the closest pair if they are not next to each other.

However, the assertion 'assert candidate([2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0]) == [0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]' is also incorrect because the expected output is not matching the actual output.

The expected output for prime numbers should be 1, but the function will incorrectly return the prime number itself. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."

exp_6_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for prime numbers. The loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. Instead, it should only check up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function incorrectly identifies 13441 as a prime number, as it is actually not prime (it is 11 * 1223). This discrepancy is evident in the test assertions, where the assertion for candidate(13441) should return False, but it currently returns True."
exp_6_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `poly` function contains an error in the comment and the actual computation. The comment states that the polynomial should be evaluated as 'xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n', but the code actually uses 'xs[1] * x^2' instead of 'xs[2] * x^2' for the second coefficient. This leads to incorrect polynomial evaluation. Additionally, the `find_zero` function's logic for finding the zero of the polynomial is flawed and may not converge correctly, especially for polynomials of higher degrees. The test assertions in the `check` function are designed to validate the `find_zero` function, but since `poly` is incorrectly implemented, the results will not be reliable."
exp_6_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly handle the sorting of values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it attempts to sort the individual elements (which are integers) and appends them directly to the new list. This results in incorrect outputs. For example, in the case of the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the function will not produce this result. The correct approach should involve collecting the values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back into their respective positions in the new list."

The purpose of the check is to verify that the decoding function correctly reverses the encoding process. Therefore, it should call 'decode_cyclic' with the encoded string and assert that it returns the original string. Additionally, the test does not account for the fact that the encoded string may not match the original string if the encoding is not reversible, which is a potential issue with the implementation."

exp_6_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' does not correctly identify all combinations of three distinct elements that sum to zero. The current logic only checks consecutive elements after sorting the list, which means it will miss valid combinations that are not adjacent. For example, in the list [1, 3, -2, 1], the valid triplet is (1, -2, 1), but the function will not find it because it only checks (1, 3, -2) and (3, -2, 1). A correct approach would involve checking all combinations of three distinct elements, which can be achieved using nested loops or combinations from the itertools module."

For example, in the test case pairs_sum_to_zero([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30]), the correct pair (-3, 3) sums to zero, but the function will not find it because it only checks adjacent elements. A correct implementation should check for all possible pairs of distinct elements in the list."

Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(16, 2) == ""10000""' is also incorrect because the base-2 representation of 16 is '10000', which is correct, but the function does not support numbers greater than 9 in base conversion as per the docstring.

This discrepancy indicates that the function does not produce the correct median for this input. Additionally, the median of the sorted list [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000] should indeed be (6 + 10) / 2 = 8.0, which is what the assertion checks for, but it contradicts the function's comment that states the expected output should be 15.0.

Additionally, the test case 'acBAA' should return 'cB', but the function will return 'cBAA'. The function also does not handle the case where the input string contains mixed case vowels correctly, as seen in the test case 'EcBOO', which should return 'cB' but will return 'cBOO'.

It will always return the index of the first occurrence in the 'even_values' list, which may not correspond to its index in the original array. For example, in the case of 'candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])', the smallest even value is 0, which appears at indices 1 and 3 in the original array.

Additionally, the expected area for the test case triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should return approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433.

For example, the function does not correctly handle cases where elements need to be changed in a more complex manner than what is accounted for in the hardcoded conditions.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where the product of three primes includes repeated primes (e.g., 2 * 2 * 3 = 12). The test cases also reveal inconsistencies, such as is_multiply_prime(8) returning True, which is incorrect since 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, and does not involve three distinct primes. Furthermore, the check for a number greater than or equal to 100 is not implemented, as the function only checks if 'a' is less than 100 but does not restrict the input accordingly."

The use of 'int(log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues, especially when x is not an exact power of n. For example, 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' should return True, but it may not due to the way logarithms are calculated. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that contradict the definition of a simple power (e.g., 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True' is incorrect as 9 is not a power of 3). Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."
exp_6_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it does not properly check if the cube root of 'a' is an integer.

For example, 'iscube(-8)' would return False instead of True, as the cube root of -8 is -2, which is an integer. A more reliable approach would be to calculate the cube of the rounded cube root and compare it to 'a'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect; it should be 'assert candidate(1728) == True' since 1728 is a perfect cube (12^3)."

The function should iterate through the characters of the input string, check if each character is one of the specified prime hexadecimal digits, and maintain a count of such digits. The test cases provided in the `check` function may also fail due to the incomplete implementation of the counting logic."

For example, the string 'abc' would incorrectly return True, but it should return True since all characters are distinct. However, the string 'aab' would incorrectly return True as well, but it should return False since 'a' is repeated. The correct check should ensure that s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] are all distinct."

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case of strings with lengths that are not prime, as it only checks divisibility up to the length of the string, which can lead to incorrect results for certain lengths. For example, it will return True for a string of length 4 (which is not prime) because it does not check the divisibility by 2 correctly. The test cases also include strings of length 0 and 1, which are not handled correctly."

Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions are incorrect. For example, for n=2, the valid numbers are 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, 21, ..., 91, 01, which totals to 18, but the logic does not correctly account for all valid cases.

The current implementation uses 'sorted(s.split())', which sorts the list of words (not the characters within each word) and joins them without spaces. This leads to incorrect outputs for cases like 'Hello World!!!', where the characters in 'Hello' and 'World!!!' should be sorted individually, but the function instead sorts the words as a whole. The expected output for 'Hello World!!!' should be 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the function does not produce this result."

The docstring specifies that the letters should shift down by 'two multiplied to two places', which implies a shift of 4 positions (2 * 2). However, the implementation correctly shifts letters by 4 positions. The issue arises with the test cases provided. For example, the test case 'faewfawefaewg' should return 'jeiajeaijeiak', but the actual output from the function does not match this expected output. Therefore, the function does not pass all the assertions, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."

Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the smallest element appears multiple times. For example, in the case of next_smallest([1, 1]), it correctly returns None, but in the case of next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), it incorrectly returns 1 instead of None, as there is no distinct second smallest element. Additionally, the function does not account for cases where all elements are the same or where there are fewer than two unique elements. The sorting approach is not sufficient to ensure the correct second smallest value is returned."

Therefore, it fails to account for all possible cases where one number could be the sum of the other two. Additionally, the type check for integers is only performed if 'x' is the sum of 'y' and 'z', which means that if 'x' is not the sum, the function could return True incorrectly if 'x' is an integer and 'y' and 'z' are not. The test cases also include scenarios that would not be handled correctly by the current implementation."

For example, 'a' should be replaced with 'c' and 'A' with 'C', but the current implementation does not swap the case correctly for the vowels. Additionally, the output for the test case 'TEST' should be 'tGst' instead of 'tgst', as the 'E' should be replaced with 'G' and the case of 'T' should be swapped.

The filtering approach is inefficient and incorrect, as it does not account for all possible prime numbers and does not return the correct largest prime. Additionally, the function does not compute the sum of the digits of the largest prime found. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will likely fail."

Specifically, the nested loops that check for upper and lower case keys are flawed. The function should first determine if all keys are either lower case or upper case, but the current implementation incorrectly checks each key multiple times and does not properly handle the case where both types of keys exist. Additionally, the check for an empty dictionary is redundant since the first 'if not dict' already handles that case.

For example, the output for 'count_up_to(6)' should be [2, 3, 5] but the hardcoded value is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where n is greater than 24, as it is incomplete and cuts off at 'elif n == 24:'.

This behavior contradicts the requirement to round away from zero in such cases."

Similarly, when n is odd, it calls 'make_a_pile(n-2)', which also leads to incorrect results. The correct approach should involve maintaining the sequence of odd or even numbers based on the initial value of n, rather than decrementing n by 1 or 2. Therefore, the test assertions will fail for certain cases."

For example, rounded_avg(1, 5) should return '0b11' (which is correct), but rounded_avg(7, 13) should return '0b1011' instead of '0b1010' because the average of integers from 7 to 13 is 10.

Secondly, the repeated lines of code that convert integers to strings are excessive and unnecessary.

However, the current implementation only calculates the product of the signs and does not compute the sum of the magnitudes. For example, for the input [1, 2, 2, -4], the expected output is -9, but the function will return -1 (the product of signs) instead of the correct value. Additionally, the test case assertions include checks that expect the function to return specific values based on the described behavior, which the current implementation does not satisfy."

The function is incomplete as it lacks the implementation of the 'shortestPath' function, which is crucial for finding the correct path. Additionally, the logic for determining the minimum path based on lexicographical order is not present. The test cases provided in the check function may not yield the expected results due to these issues, particularly since the pathfinding logic is not implemented."

The recurrence relation for odd n is incorrectly defined in the code. The function only returns a static list for n = 0, 1, and 2, and does not properly handle the case for n > 2. Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions do not match the expected values based on the provided recurrence relations. For example, tri(3) should compute based on tri(2), tri(1), and tri(4), but the current implementation does not calculate tri(4) correctly, leading to incorrect results in the assertions."

The expression 'i for i in str(n) if i%2!= 0' attempts to filter odd digits, but 'i' is a string character, and the modulo operation cannot be applied directly to strings. This will raise a TypeError. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it will attempt to compute the product of an empty list, which will also raise an error. The correct approach should convert the characters back to integers before applying the modulo operation and handle the case of no odd digits returning 0."

The current implementation only checks if the number of opening and closing brackets are equal, which does not guarantee that the brackets are nested correctly. For example, the input '[][]' has equal counts but is not nested, while '[[]]' is nested and should return True. The function fails to account for the structure of the brackets, leading to incorrect results for several test cases."

The ceiling function for negative numbers will round towards zero, which is not the intended behavior for squaring. For example, -2.4 should round to -2, and squaring it gives 4, but the expected behavior is to round it to -2 and then square it, resulting in a positive value. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases involving negative numbers."
exp_6_HumanEval/134,HumanEval/134,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter is incorrect because it does not properly check if the last character is not part of a word.

Specifically, the logic for finding the largest negative integer is flawed; it should track the maximum of negative integers, but it incorrectly initializes 'a' to None and does not update it correctly when a larger negative integer is found. For example, in the test case 'largest_smallest_integers([-1, -3, -5, -6])', the expected output is (-1, None), but the function would return (-1, None) correctly. However, in cases where there are multiple negative integers, it fails to return the correct largest negative integer. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no positive integers correctly, as it should return None for 'b' when there are no positive integers, which it does, but the logic is convoluted and can lead to errors in other scenarios."

The current implementation only calculates the regular factorial (n!) recursively, rather than the product of all factorials from n down to 1. The expected output for special_factorial(4) is 288, which is the product of 4! (24), 3! (6), 2! (2), and 1! (1), but the function only returns 24 for n=4.

Specifically, it fails to check the number of digits in the file name. The first condition states that there should not be more than three digits in the file's name, but the code does not implement this check. Additionally, the first condition checks if the length of the file name is greater than 3, which is incorrect. The length check should not be based solely on the total length of the file name but rather on the number of digits present. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return 'Yes' for file names that contain more than three digits, leading to incorrect results for several test cases."

Specifically, the condition for cubing (i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0) is checked after the squaring condition (i % 3 == 0), which means that if an index is a multiple of 3, it will be squared and not checked for cubing. This leads to incorrect results for indices that are multiples of both 3 and 4. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030' is expected to fail because the function does not correctly compute the sum based on the specified rules. The function should first check if an index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3 before checking for multiples of 3."

For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, so it should not return anything for the input 'here'. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' is correct, but the function fails to account for other words correctly. The function also fails to return correct results for words like 'Hi' (length 2, prime) and 'Hussein' (length 7, prime) in the test case 'Hi I am Hussein', as it incorrectly returns 'Hi am Hussein' instead of 'Hi Hussein'. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The sort function in Python is stable, meaning it preserves the order of records that have the same key. However, the current implementation does not consider the index of the elements in the original list when there are ties in the sum of digits. The function should use a tuple as the key for sorting, which includes both the sum of digits and the original index of the element to ensure the correct ordering. This is evident from the test cases where the expected output does not match the actual output for certain inputs."
exp_6_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' does not correctly check the first digit of the number. The condition '(num // 10) % 2 == 1' only checks the second-to-last digit for oddness, rather than the first digit. For example, the number 15 would pass the check for the last digit being odd, but the first digit (1) is also odd, which is correct. However, for a number like 21, it would incorrectly count it as valid since the first digit (2) is even. Therefore, the function fails to accurately count numbers where both the first and last digits are odd."

The slicing operation 'planets[planet1:planet2]' is incorrect because it assumes 'planets' is a list or similar structure that supports slicing by names, which it is not. Additionally, the order of the planets is not considered, as the function does not handle the case where 'planet1' is further from the sun than 'planet2'. The function should first determine the indices of the planets in a predefined list and then return the planets between those indices. Furthermore, the test cases include assertions that would fail due to the incorrect implementation."

For example, in the test case 'assert candidate(['school', 'AI', 'asdf', 'b'])', the expected output is ['AI', 'asdf', 'school'], but the function will return ['AI', 'school', 'asdf'] because it only sorts by length. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' is incorrect as the function should handle varying lengths.

For example, the number 3 is prime but would return 'y' (the second argument) due to the current implementation. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of 'n' being less than 2, which is not prime. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements as described in the comments."

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where two extensions have the same strength; it should return the first one in the list, but the current logic does not ensure this. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

For example, the test case 'cycpattern_check(""abab"",""baa"")' should return True, but the current implementation would not find 'baa' or any of its rotations in 'abab'. Additionally, the return statement inside the loop will prematurely exit after the first iteration, which is incorrect. The function needs to generate all rotations of 'b' and check each one against 'a'."

In such cases, the function should return the total eaten carrots as number + remaining and the remaining carrots as 0, which is correctly done in the else clause. However, the first return statement incorrectly calculates the number of carrots left after meals, which should be the remaining carrots minus the difference between total eaten and need, not the need itself.

However, the current implementation evaluates the operations strictly from left to right without considering precedence, which can yield incorrect results. Additionally, the use of floor division (//) and exponentiation (**) may lead to unexpected results if not handled properly.

Instead, it has a series of conditional statements that return the first and third elements of the list for any length greater than two, which does not fulfill the requirement of finding the closest pair. The test cases provided in the 'check' function would fail because the function does not compute the closest elements based on their values, leading to incorrect results."
exp_7_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function rescale_to_unit is intended to rescale a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output is not valid. The function should return [1.0, 0.0] for the input [100.0, 49.9], but the implementation will return [1.0, 0.0] as expected. The test case is incorrectly asserting the order of the output, which should be [0.0, 1.0] for the input [49.9, 100.0]. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases contain an error."
exp_7_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance(value, int)' to check for integers, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various cases including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_7_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function.

Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_7_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' is intended to find the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n'. However, the implementation starts the loop from 'n' and checks for divisibility, which will always return 'n' itself on the first iteration. The loop should start from 'n-1' to ensure that the returned divisor is smaller than 'n'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."
exp_7_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the factorize function does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect factorization. For example, when factorizing 70, the function will return [2, 5, 7] correctly, but for other numbers like 18, it will not return [2, 3, 3] as expected. The function also does not handle cases where a number has repeated prime factors correctly, as it may skip some factors. The test cases provided in the check function will fail for certain inputs, indicating that the implementation is not robust and does not adhere to the expected behavior described in the docstring."
exp_7_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence. This means that if an element appears multiple times, it will not be included in the result at all. For example, in the test case candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output is [1, 4, 5], but the implementation will return [1, 2, 4, 5] because it only checks for the presence of the number in the result list and does not account for how many times it appears in the input list."

However, the test assertion check(candidate) includes a case where the expected output for the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] with prefix 'xxx' is ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], which is incorrect. The correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list. The function does not account for duplicate entries in the output, which leads to a mismatch with the expected results."
exp_7_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is supposed to return only positive numbers from the input list.

However, the first test assertion is incorrect because it expects [4, 5, 6] but the function returns [4, 5, 6] which is correct. The function is correct in its implementation but the test cases are misleading. Therefore, the evaluation is INCORRECT."
exp_7_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for prime numbers. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so it suffices to check for factors up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of n being 0 or negative correctly, as it should return False for these values. The test cases provided in the check function are mostly correct, but the implementation will fail for larger prime numbers due to inefficiency."
exp_7_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'find_zero' is intended to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in 'xs'. However, the implementation of 'find_zero' is flawed. The logic used to calculate 'x' does not correctly find the root of the polynomial. The method of summing the negative ratios of coefficients does not guarantee convergence to a root. Additionally, the test function 'check' is incorrectly testing 'poly' instead of 'find_zero', which means it does not validate the correctness of the root-finding logic. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. The function first appends the values at indices divisible by three to 'l_new', sorts 'l_new', and then appends the values at indices 1 and 2, which results in an incorrect output. The correct approach should involve sorting only the values at indices divisible by three and then reconstructing the list with those sorted values in their respective positions. The provided test cases also indicate that the output does not match the expected results."
exp_7_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to remove duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the resulting unique elements. The provided test assertion confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given input.
exp_7_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct, but the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10] and expects 124, but the actual maximum is 124, which is correct. However, the original example in the docstring of the function shows the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] as 123, which is also correct. The issue arises from the fact that the assertion in the check function is testing for a different value than what is expected based on the original function's docstring. Therefore, while the function works correctly, the test case is misleading and incorrect."
exp_7_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is supposed to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' correctly. The test cases provided in the check function, particularly for larger values of n, suggest that the expected counts of '7's are incorrect. The function does not return the correct counts for the test cases, indicating that the logic for counting occurrences of '7' is flawed or the expected results in the test cases are incorrect."

However, the implementation incorrectly sorts both even and odd indexed values and then combines them, which does not meet the requirements stated in the function's docstring. For example, in the test case sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]), the expected output is [3, 6, 5, 4], but the function would return [3, 4, 5, 6], which is incorrect."
exp_7_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should verify that decoding the encoded string returns the original string, which means it should call 'decode_cyclic' instead of 'encode_cyclic'. Therefore, the test will always fail, leading to an incorrect evaluation of the encoding and decoding process."
exp_7_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is not correctly implemented to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. The provided implementation only returns the first two prime Fibonacci numbers (2 and 3) for n=1 and n=2, respectively, and for n > 2, it incorrectly calls a function 'fibonacci(n)' which is not defined in the provided code. This will lead to an error when n is greater than 2. The expected outputs for n=6, n=7, n=8, n=9, and n=10 are also not handled correctly as the function does not compute the Fibonacci sequence or check for primality beyond the first two cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it only checks for the sum of three consecutive elements in the sorted list. This approach does not account for the possibility of non-consecutive elements that could also sum to zero. For example, in the list [1, 3, -2, 1], the elements 1, -2, and 1 (which are not consecutive) sum to zero, but the current implementation would not find this combination. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirement of finding any three distinct elements that sum to zero."
exp_7_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it contains only a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any calculations or return any values. The expected output for the test cases suggests that the function should return n * n (the square of n), which indicates the number of collisions between the two sets of cars. However, since the function is not implemented, it cannot produce any output, leading to a failure in all assertions in the 'check' function."

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2], but the correct output from 'incr_list([3, 2, 1])' is [4, 3, 2]. The assertion is actually correct, but the reasoning for the evaluation is based on the assumption that the test cases should match the expected output from the function, which they do not. Therefore, the overall evaluation is incorrect due to the mismatch in expected outputs in the test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,True,CORRECT,"The function pairs_sum_to_zero correctly implements the logic to check for two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. It first checks if the list has fewer than two elements, returning False if so. Then, it uses a nested loop to check all pairs of elements.

exp_7_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'change_base' is correct for converting numbers to bases between 2 and 10. However, the test cases in the 'check' function include an assertion 'assert candidate(9, 3) == ""100""', which is incorrect because the base 3 representation of 9 is '1000', not '100'. Therefore, the function fails to pass all the test assertions, indicating that the implementation is not fully correct."

Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is mostly correct, but the second test assertion in the check function is incorrect. The expected median for the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] should be 15.0, but the implementation returns 8.0. This discrepancy indicates that the code does not correctly compute the median for this specific input, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation."

The decode_shift function also has a similar issue. Both functions assume that the input string consists only of lowercase letters, which is not guaranteed. Additionally, the decode_shift function is incorrectly using the encode_shift function in the check function, which should instead call decode_shift to verify the decoding process. Therefore, the tests will fail for any input that includes uppercase letters, digits, or special characters."

However, the test case 'acBAA' is expected to return 'cB', but the implementation would return 'cB' as well, which is also correct. The test case 'EcBOO' is expected to return 'cB', but the implementation would return 'cB' as well, which is correct. The test case 'ybcd' is expected to return 'ybcd', and the implementation would return 'ybcd' as well, which is correct. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases are not comprehensive enough to cover all edge cases.

The test cases provided in the docstring suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True because they both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', even though their frequencies differ. The current implementation fails to meet this requirement."
exp_7_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a recursive approach.

exp_7_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to determine if the elements of the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation does not correctly handle cases where the list contains duplicate elements. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] is considered monotonically decreasing according to the implementation, but it should not be classified as such because of the presence of equal elements. The expected behavior for monotonicity should allow for equal elements in a non-decreasing or non-increasing sequence, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly."

It pushes an opening bracket onto the stack and pops from the stack for each closing bracket. If a closing bracket is encountered when the stack is empty, it returns False, indicating an unmatched closing bracket.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function passes all assertions, confirming its correctness."
exp_7_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function is incorrect because it does not properly compute the derivative of the polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial term ax^n is n*ax^(n-1). The current implementation incorrectly calculates the coefficients of the derivative. For example, for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the expected derivative is [1, 4, 12, 20], but the function returns [1, 4, 12, 20] which is correct. However, for the input [3, 2, 1, 0, 4], the expected output should be [12, 2, 0] but the function returns [2, 2, 0, 16]. This shows that the function does not handle all cases correctly."

The base cases for fibfib(0), fibfib(1), and fibfib(2) return the expected values of 0, 0, and 1, respectively. The recursive case correctly sums the values of fibfib(n-1), fibfib(n-2), and fibfib(n-3). The provided test assertions in the check function confirm that the implementation produces the correct outputs for the specified inputs, including fibfib(5) == 4, fibfib(8) == 24, and additional values like fibfib(10) == 81 and fibfib(12) == 274. Therefore, the implementation is correct."

The current implementation counts 'y' as a vowel in all cases, which leads to incorrect results for test cases like 'key' and 'bye'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly since it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, such as words with mixed case or words ending with 'y'. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."

According to the function's description, if 'shift' exceeds the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the string if 'shift' is greater than the length of 'x', which is correct. The issue arises in the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""', which is expected to return '001' but instead returns '00' because the leading zero is not preserved in the string representation of the integer. The correct behavior should maintain leading zeros in the output string, which is not achieved in the current implementation."

Similarly, the input 'abcCd' should yield 67 (67 for 'C'), but the expected result is also incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not match the expected outputs based on the provided test cases."

The code assumes that the number of oranges is always the third word in the string, which is not guaranteed. For example, in the string '5 apples and 6 oranges', the function correctly extracts '5' for apples but incorrectly extracts '6' for oranges because it only looks for the second index. The correct extraction should involve parsing the string more robustly to account for variations in the input format. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the number of oranges is not in the expected position."

Specifically, the function returns the smallest even value and its index, but it does not handle the case where multiple smallest even values exist correctly. The sorting step is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results when there are multiple even values with the same smallest value. Instead, the function should iterate through the list and keep track of the smallest even value and its index without sorting. This would ensure that the first occurrence of the smallest even value is returned, which is required by the problem statement."

The formula used, (a * b * c) ** (1/2), does not yield the correct area of a triangle given its sides. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle using the lengths of its sides (a, b, c) is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area values in the test cases do not match the results produced by the current implementation, indicating that the function does not return the correct area for valid triangles."

exp_7_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' is overly complex and does not correctly handle all cases. It uses a series of conditional statements for arrays of specific lengths (up to 5), which is not scalable and does not cover all possible scenarios for larger arrays. The logic for determining the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is flawed, as it does not compare elements symmetrically from the start and end of the array. A more efficient approach would involve iterating through the array from both ends towards the center, counting mismatches. The provided test cases may pass, but the function will fail for larger or different inputs, making it incorrect overall."

However, the current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as the product of two prime factors (i and a/i). It does not account for the requirement of three prime factors. Additionally, the test case assertions include cases that are not correctly handled by the function, such as is_multiply_prime(8) which should return False because 8 = 2 * 2 * 2 (not three distinct primes). The logic for checking the number of prime factors is incomplete and incorrect."

For example, for 'is_simple_power(8, 2)', the expected result is True, but the current implementation will not return True as it does not correctly compute the integer exponent. The correct approach would involve checking if there exists an integer 'k' such that 'n**k == x'. This flaw leads to incorrect results for several test cases, such as 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' which should return True but does not in the current implementation."

However, this approach fails for negative numbers because the cube root of a negative number is also negative, and converting it to an integer may not yield the correct result for the equality check. For example, iscube(-8) would return False incorrectly, as -8 is indeed a perfect cube (-2 * -2 * -2 = -8). Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect; it should check for 1728 instead, which is a perfect cube (12 * 12 * 12 = 1728)."
exp_7_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'hex_key' is intended to count the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime. However, it incorrectly includes 'A', 'C', 'E', and 'F' as valid hexadecimal digits without checking their primality. The correct prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), and D (13). The function does not account for the fact that 'A', 'C', 'E', and 'F' are not prime numbers. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is incorrect because the function does not handle an empty string input correctly; it should return 0, but the function is designed to take a string, not a list. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."

Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_7_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct. The current implementation only checks if any three consecutive letters are the same, which is not sufficient. For example, the string 'abcabc' would pass the current implementation but is not happy because 'abc' contains three distinct letters. The correct approach should check that s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] are all different."
exp_7_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values that are equal to the thresholds for letter grades. For example, the GPA of 3.0 should yield 'B+', but the code assigns 'B+' to any GPA greater than or equal to 3.0, which is correct. However, the GPA of 3.5 is incorrectly assigned 'A-' instead of 'A'. The function also incorrectly assigns 'D+' for a GPA of 1.0 instead of 'D+'. The test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, and the implementation does not match the grading table provided in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' incorrectly identifies the length of strings as prime. Specifically, it returns True for a string of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the logic used to determine if a number is prime is flawed; it checks divisibility from 2 to the length of the string, but it should only check up to the square root of the length for efficiency and correctness. For example, the string 'HI' has a length of 2, which is prime, but the function will return True, which is correct. However, the function fails for lengths like 1 and 4, which are not prime but would return True due to the flawed implementation. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' counts the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the total count. For n=1, the only number is '1', which is correctly counted as 1. For n=2, the valid numbers are '10', '11', '12', ..., '19', '21', ..., '91', '01', which totals to 18. However, for n=3, the count should include numbers from 100 to 999 that start or end with 1, which is not correctly calculated by the current logic. The function uses a brute-force approach, which is inefficient for larger n and does not account for the patterns in the numbers. A more mathematical approach would yield the correct counts without iterating through all possibilities."
exp_7_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer N, but it instead returns the binary representation of N itself. For example, for N = 1000, the sum of the digits is 1, and the expected output is '1'. However, the function returns '1111101000', which is the binary representation of 1000. The test assertions are based on the incorrect assumption that the function is correctly implemented."
exp_7_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices, but the implementation incorrectly sums the elements at even indices instead.

Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement as described in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'anti_shuffle' does not correctly sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces in the input string. The current implementation uses 'sorted(s.split(), key=lambda x: ''.join(sorted(x)))', which sorts the words based on their sorted characters, but it does not sort the characters within each word. Instead, it should sort the characters of each word individually and then join them back together while maintaining the original order of the words and spaces. For example, 'Hello World!!!' should yield 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation does not achieve this correctly."

After finding the coordinates of the target integer 'x', the function sorts the list of tuples by rows in ascending order, but it does not sort the coordinates of each row by columns in descending order. Instead, it modifies the column index to be the reverse index (from the end of the row), which does not fulfill the requirement of sorting by columns in descending order. Therefore, the output does not match the expected results in all test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' does not correctly adhere to the specified sorting criteria based on the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of checking the sum of the first and last elements, it incorrectly checks the sum of all elements in the array. This leads to incorrect sorting behavior for cases where the sum of the first and last elements is odd or even. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the first element is 2 and the last element is 6, which sums to 8 (even), so it should sort in descending order, which is correctly implemented. However, for the input [21, 14, 23, 11], the first element is 21 and the last element is 11, which sums to 32 (even), but the expected output is incorrect as it does not follow the specified sorting criteria based on the first and last elements."

The function is supposed to rotate the alphabet by four places (2 multiplied by 2), but the current implementation uses the expression 'ord(x) - 97 + 2 * 2', which effectively shifts each character by four positions. However, it does not account for the fact that the input string may contain characters outside the lowercase alphabet (like spaces or uppercase letters), and it assumes all characters are lowercase letters. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function do not match the expected outputs based on the described behavior of the 'encrypt' function. For example, the output for 'faewfawefaewg' should not be 'jeiajeaijeiak' based on a correct implementation of the described rotation. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_7_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is not unique. For example, in the case of next_smallest([1,1,1,1,0]), the expected output should be None because there is no distinct second smallest element. However, the function returns 1, which is incorrect. Additionally, the case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -35 as the second smallest element, but the function will sort the list and return -35, which is correct in this case. Overall, the implementation fails to meet the requirement of returning None when there is no distinct second smallest element."
exp_7_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' only splits the input string by periods ('.') to identify sentences. However, the problem statement specifies that sentences can also be delimited by question marks ('?') and exclamation marks ('!'). As a result, sentences that end with these delimiters will not be counted correctly. For example, the input 'I love it! I am happy.' would not be counted correctly because the second sentence is not split properly. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the task."
exp_7_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' does not correctly handle the case where the sum of any two numbers equals the third number. The current implementation only checks if 'x' equals the sum of 'y' and 'z', but it should also check if 'y' equals 'x + z' and if 'z' equals 'x + y'. Additionally, the method 'is_integer()' is not applicable to integers, which will cause an error when checking integer values. The function should use 'isinstance()' to check if the inputs are integers instead."
exp_7_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly implement the encoding as described. It fails to swap the case of all letters and does not replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the alphabet. For example, in the case of 'test', the expected output is 'TGST', but the function will return 'tGST' because it does not swap the case of the consonants and incorrectly handles the vowels. Additionally, the vowel replacement logic is flawed; it should replace 'a' with 'c', 'e' with 'g', 'i' with 'k', 'o' with 'q', and 'u' with 'w', but the current implementation incorrectly attempts to access the character at index `i+2` without proper bounds checking, which could lead to index errors."

It filters out numbers from 0 to 57 without checking for primality, which is not the correct approach to find prime numbers. Additionally, the function does not compute the sum of the digits of the largest prime found, which is the requirement of the task. The test assertions will likely fail because the function does not perform the necessary calculations to return the expected results."
exp_7_HumanEval/95,HumanEval/95,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'check_dict_case' does not correctly determine if all keys are either in lower case or upper case. The condition 'elif key.isupper() != key.islower()' is incorrect because it only checks if the key is either upper or lower case, but does not ensure that all keys are uniformly in one case. The correct approach should involve checking if all keys are lower case or if all keys are upper case, which can be done using two separate flags or checks. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the dictionary is empty correctly, as it should return False, which it does, but the logic for checking the case of keys is flawed."
exp_7_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'count_up_to' is incorrect because it does not correctly return the prime numbers less than 'n'. For example, the output for 'count_up_to(6)' should be [2, 3, 5], but the function returns [2, 3, 5] which is correct. However, for 'count_up_to(7)', it incorrectly returns [2, 3, 5] instead of [2, 3, 5, 7]. Additionally, the function does not handle cases for 'n' greater than 24 correctly, as it is incomplete and ends abruptly. The function should dynamically calculate prime numbers rather than relying on hardcoded values."
exp_7_HumanEval/97,HumanEval/97,True,INCORRECT,"The function multiply is supposed to return the product of the unit digits of the two integers. However, the expected outputs in the test cases do not match the actual outputs of the function. For instance, multiply(19, 28) should return 72, but the unit digits are 9 and 8, which multiply to 72. The function correctly computes the unit digits but fails to account for the expected outputs in the test cases. Specifically, the expected output for multiply(148, 412) is incorrectly stated as 16, as the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16. The expected output for multiply(76, 67) is also incorrect; the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect based on the provided test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/98,HumanEval/98,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_upper is intended to count uppercase vowels at even indices of the string. However, the test case count_upper('EEEE') returns 2, which is incorrect because the uppercase vowels 'E' are located at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3. Only the characters at even indices (0 and 2) should be counted, which means the correct return value should be 1. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the requirement of counting uppercase vowels at even indices."

Similarly, when n is odd, it should add 2 to n for the next level, but the base case for n=1 is also incorrect since it should return a list starting from n. The test cases provided in the 'check' function will fail due to these issues."
exp_7_HumanEval/101,HumanEval/101,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'words_string' does not correctly handle the splitting of words when they are separated by both commas and spaces.

It only checks if x is even and returns it if y is greater than or equal to x, but it does not consider the case where y is greater than x and there might be a larger even number within the range. For example, for the input (6, 29), the function returns 6 instead of 28, which is the largest even number in that range. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x is greater than y correctly, as it should return -1 in such cases regardless of the parity of x."

The average should be calculated as the sum of all integers from n to m divided by the count of those integers, which is (m - n + 1). The current implementation only averages n and m, which leads to incorrect results for cases where n and m are not the same. For example, rounded_avg(1, 5) should compute the average of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which is 3, and return '0b11', but the implementation does this correctly. However, for cases like rounded_avg(7, 13), the average should be 10, which is '0b1010', but the implementation does not handle this correctly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The condition 'not any(j%2==0 for j in str(i))' checks if any digit in the number is even, but it incorrectly converts the digits to strings, which leads to incorrect evaluations. For example, the number 152 contains the digit '2', which is even, but the function does not correctly identify it as having an even digit. Therefore, the output for the test case 'unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])' should be an empty list, which is correct, but the function fails to handle other cases correctly, such as 'unique_digits([12345, 2033, 111, 151])' where it should return [111, 151] but might not due to the flawed logic."

Firstly, the sorting and reversing of the array are done before filtering the integers between 1 and 9, which is incorrect. The filtering should occur first to ensure only valid integers are processed. Additionally, the mapping of integers to their corresponding names is not implemented; instead, the code attempts to convert integers to strings without any mapping. The excessive repetition of the line 'arr = [str(i) for i in arr]' is unnecessary and does not contribute to the functionality. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results as demonstrated in the test assertions."

The function only checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order for specific lengths (up to 13), which is inefficient and incorrect. The correct approach should involve checking for the number of 'drops' in the array, where a drop is defined as a point where the current element is greater than the next element. If there is more than one drop, it is impossible to sort the array with right shifts.

The function should instead check if there are enough even numbers in 'lst2' to replace the odd numbers in 'lst1'.

Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include assertions that expect outputs based on the incorrect implementation, leading to further discrepancies."
exp_7_HumanEval/129,HumanEval/129,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function minPath contains several issues. Firstly, the initialization of the grid with padding (adding -1) is incorrect and unnecessary, as it alters the original grid structure and does not contribute to the pathfinding logic. Secondly, the BFS algorithm is not correctly implemented to track the path values; it only calculates distances without storing the actual path taken. The logic for reconstructing the path at the end is flawed, as it attempts to backtrack using the grid values instead of maintaining a proper parent or predecessor mapping. Additionally, the test assertions include expected outputs that do not align with the problem description, indicating that the function does not produce the correct results for the provided test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/130,HumanEval/130,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'tri' function does not correctly compute the Tribonacci sequence as described in the comments. The recurrence relation for odd n is incorrectly defined and implemented. Specifically, the function does not calculate 'tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)' for odd n, and instead, it simply returns a static list for n >= 2. Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions do not match the expected results based on the defined Tribonacci sequence. For example, 'tri(3)' should return [1, 3, 2, 8], but the implementation does not correctly calculate the values leading to that output."

The expression 'i for i in str(n) if i%2!= 0' attempts to filter odd digits, but 'i' is a string character, and using the modulus operator '%' on a string will raise a TypeError. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it will raise an error when trying to reduce an empty list. The correct approach should convert the characters back to integers before applying the modulus operator and handle the case of no odd digits by returning 0."
exp_7_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_nested' does not correctly determine if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested. The current logic only checks if there are more opening brackets '[' than closing brackets ']', which does not guarantee that the brackets are nested. For example, the input '[][]' would return True (due to having equal counts), but it does not contain any nested brackets. The function fails to satisfy the requirements outlined in the comments and the test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' incorrectly uses 'int(round(x))' to round the numbers. The task requires rounding to the upper integer (ceiling), which should be done using 'math.ceil(x)' instead of 'round'. This will lead to incorrect results for non-integer values. For example, 'math.ceil(1.4)' should return 2, but 'int(round(1.4))' returns 1. Consequently, the test assertions that rely on the correct rounding will fail."
exp_7_HumanEval/134,HumanEval/134,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly determine if the last character is part of a word. The condition 'txt[-1] not in txt[:-1]' is meant to check if the last character is not part of any word, but it fails in cases where the last character is a letter that is part of a word. For example, in the string 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed part of a word, but the function would incorrectly return True. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string has trailing spaces correctly, as it does not check for spaces before the last character. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."

However, the function will return 1 because it only checks the first occurrence and stops. Additionally, the test case can_arrange([1,2,4,5]) is expected to return -1, which is correct, but the logic in the function does not cover all scenarios correctly."
exp_7_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly identify the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. Specifically, the function sorts the list and then checks only the first element for negativity, which does not guarantee that the largest negative integer is found. Additionally, it incorrectly returns the smallest positive integer as the first element of the sorted list, which may not be correct if there are multiple positive integers. For example, in the case of the input [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, -2], the expected output is (-2, 1), but the function may not return this correctly due to its flawed logic."
exp_7_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle string representations of numbers correctly, especially when they contain commas or periods. For example, the input compare_one(1, '2,3') should convert '2,3' to a float (2.3) before comparison, but the current implementation compares the values as they are, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the function does not handle the conversion of strings to numbers, which is necessary for proper comparison. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

However, the implementation only checks for specific even numbers up to 150 and returns True for them, which is incorrect. For example, 14 can be expressed as 2 + 2 + 2 + 8, but it is not included in the True cases. Additionally, the function does not consider the fact that any even number greater than or equal to 8 can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's purpose."
exp_7_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' does not correctly compute the Brazilian factorial as defined in the comments. The function currently only computes the regular factorial of 'n' recursively, which does not account for the multiplication of all factorials from (n-1)! down to 1!. The correct implementation should involve a loop or recursive calls that multiply the factorials of all integers from 1 to n. Therefore, the test cases will fail, as the expected results do not match the output of the current implementation."

The current implementation replaces all spaces with underscores first and then attempts to replace underscores with hyphens, which does not achieve the desired behavior. For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but it will not because the underscores are not correctly replaced based on the number of consecutive spaces."

The check for the length of the file name being greater than 3 is incorrect; it should be checking the count of digits instead. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the substring after the dot is empty, nor does it correctly validate the file extension against the allowed list. The logic for checking the dot and the starting character is also flawed, as it does not account for the position of the dot correctly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."

Specifically, the function squares the integer at index 0 (which is correct), but it also incorrectly cubes the integer at index 4 when it should not, as index 4 is not a multiple of 3. Additionally, the function modifies the original list, which is not specified in the requirements. The test cases also include cases that the function fails to pass, such as the case with the list [-56,-99,1,0,-2], which should return 3030 but does not due to incorrect calculations. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_7_HumanEval/143,HumanEval/143,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly return words whose lengths are prime numbers. The function uses 'return''.join(...)' which concatenates the words without spaces, leading to incorrect output. Additionally, the function does not define the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for checking if the length of a word is prime. Without this function, the code will raise an error when executed. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_7_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly determine if the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality rather than checking if the product is a whole number. To check if the product of the fractions x and n is a whole number, the correct condition should be 'if (x_num * n_num) % (x_den * n_den) == 0'. This means that the numerator of the product must be divisible by the denominator of the product. As a result, the function fails for several test cases, such as 'simplify(""1/5"", ""1/5"")' which should return True, but the current implementation returns False."
exp_7_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not maintain the original order of elements with the same sum of digits. The `sort` method is stable, but the lambda function used for sorting only considers the sum of the digits and does not account for the original indices of the elements when the sums are equal.

exp_7_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' does not correctly check the first digit of the number. The condition '(num // 10) % 2 == 1' only checks the second digit for oddness, not the first digit. For example, the number 21 would pass the current check because 2 is even, but it should not be counted since the first digit (2) is not odd.

It only checks for valid planet names and returns an empty tuple in most cases. Additionally, the variable 'planets' is not defined in the provided code, which would lead to a NameError. The function should also handle the case where the planets are in the correct order and return the planets in between them. The repeated checks for planet names are redundant and indicate a lack of proper implementation."

However, the implementation incorrectly checks if n is even (n % 2 == 0) to determine the return value. This logic does not correctly identify prime numbers, as many odd numbers are not prime (e.g., 9, 15). The test cases also include assertions that would fail due to this incorrect logic. For example, x_or_y(7, 34, 12) should return 34 (correct), but x_or_y(15, 8, 5) should return 5 (correct), yet the implementation does not correctly handle all cases of prime checking."

The current logic only checks if 'b' is a substring starting from each index of 'a', which does not account for the rotations of 'b'. For example, the rotation of 'b' should be checked by concatenating 'b' with itself (i.e., 'b + b') and then checking if any substring of this concatenated string exists in 'a'. Additionally, the loop will prematurely return False after the first iteration if 'b' is not found at the first index, which is incorrect. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."

The correct logic should account for the fact that if the rabbit cannot meet its needs, it should eat all remaining carrots and still be hungry. For example, in the case of 'eat(2, 11, 5)', the rabbit should eat all 5 remaining carrots, resulting in a total of 7 eaten and 0 remaining, which is correctly handled, but the condition fails for other cases.

exp_8_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function rescale_to_unit is designed to rescale a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output is not valid. The correct output for this input should be [1.0, 0.0] if the function is applied correctly, but the assertion is misleading as it implies that the order of the output should match the input order, which is not the case in the context of rescaling. The function itself is correct, but the test case is flawed."
exp_8_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension that checks if each value is an instance of 'int', which aligns with the function's purpose as described in the docstring. The provided test cases in the 'check' function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they return the expected results for various inputs."
exp_8_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, and they all pass successfully. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_8_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' is supposed to find the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n'. However, the implementation starts the loop from 'n' and checks for divisibility, which will return 'n' itself on the first iteration. The correct implementation should start from 'n-1' and go downwards to find the largest divisor smaller than 'n'. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements as it does not return the correct result for any input 'n' greater than 1."
exp_8_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'factorize' does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect factorization. For example, when factorizing 70, the function will return [2, 5, 7] correctly, but for other numbers like 18, it will not return [2, 3, 3] as expected. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input number is a prime number or a composite number with repeated factors correctly. The test assertions also include cases that the implementation fails to satisfy, such as factorizing 9, which should return [3, 3] but will not be tested here. Overall, the implementation does not guarantee the correct order or count of prime factors."
exp_8_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation incorrectly retains elements that appear only once. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4] because 2 occurs more than once and should be removed. However, the implementation retains 2 in the output, which is incorrect. The assertion check(candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])) fails because the output is not as expected."
exp_8_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'swapcase()' effectively changes lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

exp_8_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The function 'concatenate' correctly implements the logic to concatenate a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the behavior of 'concatenate' against various cases, including an empty list and a list with multiple strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements."
exp_8_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']) is incorrect because it expects 'xxxAAA' to be included in the result, but 'xxxAAA' does not start with 'xxx' (it starts with 'xxxA'). The correct output should only include 'xxx' and not 'xxxAAA'. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all test assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function get_positive correctly filters out non-positive numbers from the input list, returning only positive numbers as specified in the docstring. The test assertions provided in the check function validate the correctness of the implementation against various scenarios, including lists with negative numbers, a mix of positive and negative numbers, and empty lists. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_8_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for prime numbers. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. A prime number check only needs to iterate up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for n = 2 correctly, as it will return True, but the loop will still run unnecessarily. This could lead to performance issues for larger numbers. The test cases provided in the check function do include cases that would fail with the current implementation, such as when n is a composite number."
exp_8_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function contains a logical error in the way it calculates the zero of the polynomial. The method used to update 'x' in the loop does not guarantee convergence to a root of the polynomial. Specifically, the expression 'x -= xs[i] / poly(xs[i + 1:], x)' can lead to incorrect results, as it does not properly account for the behavior of the polynomial at the current estimate of 'x'. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the polynomial may not have a real root or where the method fails to converge. The test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the correctness of the 'find_zero' function, but since 'poly' is being tested instead, it does not validate the correctness of 'find_zero'. Therefore, the overall implementation is incorrect."
exp_8_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it appends the sorted value of the individual element at that index, which is incorrect. The function should collect all values at indices divisible by three, sort them, and then replace the corresponding indices in the new list with these sorted values. The test assertions also indicate that the expected output does not match the actual output of the function."
exp_8_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to eliminate duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the resulting unique elements. The provided test assertion also confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given input, producing the correct output."
exp_8_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct, as it uses the built-in 'max' function to return the maximum element from the list. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], but it incorrectly expects the result to be 124 instead of the correct maximum value, which is 124. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed due to the faulty test case."
exp_8_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' in those numbers. The provided test cases indicate that the expected counts of '7's for certain inputs do not match the actual counts produced by the function. For example, the expected output for fizz_buzz(78) is 2, but the function counts the occurrences incorrectly. The logic for counting '7's is flawed, as it does not account for all numbers divisible by 11 or 13 correctly. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_8_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly return a list where the even indices are sorted while the odd indices remain unchanged. The current implementation creates a new list 'l_odd' that only contains the values from the odd indices and appends the sorted even values to it, which results in a list that does not maintain the original structure of the input list. Instead, the function should create a new list that combines the sorted even indexed values and the unchanged odd indexed values in their respective positions."
exp_8_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it incorrectly checks 'encode_cyclic' instead. Additionally, the 'decode_cyclic' function is implemented correctly to reverse the encoding done by 'encode_cyclic'. Therefore, the test assertions are not validating the decoding functionality as intended."
exp_8_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is not correctly implemented to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. The current implementation only handles the first two cases (n=1 and n=2) correctly by returning 2 and 3, respectively. For n >= 3, it calls a function 'fibonacci(n)', which is not defined in the provided code. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime; thus, the logic to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_8_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is not implemented, which means it cannot produce any output or behavior. Therefore, it cannot pass any assertions in the 'check' function.

exp_8_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it only contains a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not return any value, and the assertions in the 'check' function will fail. The expected output for the number of collisions is calculated as n * n (or n^2), which is indicated by the test assertions. However, without an implementation, the function cannot produce any output, leading to an incorrect evaluation."
exp_8_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is correctly implemented to increment each element of the list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test case is not validating the function correctly, leading to a failure in the test. Therefore, while the function itself is correct, the tests do not accurately reflect the expected behavior."
exp_8_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function pairs_sum_to_zero is incorrect because it does not correctly check for pairs of distinct elements that sum to zero. The current logic only checks adjacent elements after sorting the list, which can miss valid pairs that are not next to each other. For example, in the test case pairs_sum_to_zero([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30]), the function should return True because -3 and 3 are distinct elements that sum to zero, but the current implementation may not find this pair due to the sorting step. A correct approach would involve checking all combinations of elements to find any two distinct elements that sum to zero."
exp_8_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is designed to convert a number 'x' into a specified base 'base', but it does not handle cases where the base is greater than 10 correctly. The test case 'assert candidate(9, 3) == ""100""' is incorrect because the expected output for converting 9 to base 3 should be '100', which is correct. However, the function's implementation does not account for bases greater than 10, which is not explicitly stated in the comments. Additionally, the comment states that base numbers are less than 10, which contradicts the test cases provided. Therefore, the implementation is not consistent with the function's description and the test cases."

All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the implementation is correct."
exp_8_HumanEval/46,HumanEval/46,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fib4 function uses recursion instead of an iterative approach as specified in the comments. This violates the requirement to not use recursion. Additionally, the expected outputs for the test cases provided in the comments do not match the outputs generated by the current implementation. For example, fib4(5) should return 4 according to the comments, but the recursive implementation does not compute this correctly due to the incorrect base cases and recursive logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is correct in terms of logic, but the test assertions provided in the check function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]) == 8.0' is incorrect; the correct median for this input should be 15.0, as the sorted list is [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000] and the median is the average of 6 and 10. Therefore, the test cases do not accurately reflect the expected outputs, leading to a failure in the test."

exp_8_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode_shift' function is incorrect because it does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet ('a' to 'z'). It assumes that all input characters are lowercase letters, which can lead to incorrect behavior or errors when the input contains uppercase letters, digits, or special characters. Additionally, the 'decode_shift' function is supposed to decode the string encoded by 'encode_shift', but it also has the same issue with character handling. The test assertions in the 'check' function will fail if the input string contains any characters that are not lowercase letters."

The test cases suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return False, which is correct, but 'abcd' and 'dddddddabc' should return False, which is incorrect according to the function's logic. The function should compare the unique characters in both strings, not their sorted versions."

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function passes all assertions, confirming its correctness."
exp_8_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly returns True for lists that contain equal elements in a decreasing sequence. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False because it is not strictly decreasing (due to the repeated '1'). The test case for this input in the 'check' function expects True, which is inconsistent with the definition of monotonicity. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly adhere to the function's description."

For example, for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the expected output should be [1, 4, 12, 20], but the implementation returns [1, 4, 12, 20] as expected. However, the test case with input [3, 2, 1, 0, 4] should yield [12, 2, 0] instead of [2, 2, 0, 16]. Therefore, the implementation fails to correctly compute the derivative for all cases."

The code assumes that the number of oranges is always the third element in the split string, which is not guaranteed. For example, in the string '5 apples and 6 oranges', the number of oranges is at index 4 after splitting, not index 2. This will lead to incorrect results for any input where the number of oranges is not at the expected position. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct number of mangoes in certain cases, making the overall implementation incorrect."

The line 'min_even_value_index = even_values.index(min_even_value)' retrieves the index of 'min_even_value' in the 'even_values' list, which does not correspond to the original index in the input array 'arr'. This leads to incorrect results when there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even value. For example, in the case of 'candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])', the function would return [0, 1] instead of [0, 1] because it finds the first zero in the 'even_values' list, which is not the correct index in the original array."

Specifically, it does not count the frequency of each integer in the list and does not check if that frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself. The current implementation only returns the first integer it encounters that is greater than zero, without considering its frequency. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4])', the expected output is -1, but the function would return 5, which is incorrect.

The current implementation uses 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x%2)', which sorts the list based on whether the numbers are even or odd, rather than alternating between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, such as 'strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])' returning [1, 2, 3, 4] instead of the expected [1, 4, 2, 3]. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the comments."

The formula used, (a * b * c) / (4 * (a + b + c)), does not yield the correct area for a triangle given its sides. The correct formula for the area of a triangle using its side lengths is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the test case for triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is expected to return approximately 0.43, but it should actually return 0.43 when calculated correctly using Heron's formula, which is not being used here."

The implementation only checks if the sum is less than or equal to 'w', but it does not return True if the sum is exactly equal to 'w' and the list is balanced. For example, will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) should return True, which it does, but if we had a case like will_it_fly([1, 2, 1], 4), it would incorrectly return False because the sum is equal to 'w' but the list is balanced. Therefore, the implementation does not fully satisfy the requirements outlined in the function description."

The test cases also reveal that the function incorrectly returns True for 8 and 125, which are not products of three distinct primes. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_8_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The function implementation does not correctly determine if x is a simple power of n. The expression 'n ** int(math.log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to the use of integer conversion, which may truncate the logarithm value and lead to incorrect exponentiation.

However, for is_simple_power(24, 2), the logarithm would yield a value that, when truncated, does not accurately reflect the power relationship, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x is not a power of n correctly, as seen in the test cases provided."

For example, for n=2, the valid integers are 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, 21, 31, ..., 91, totaling 18, which is correct, but the function's logic does not efficiently derive this.

Similarly, for N = 150, the sum of its digits is 6, which should return '110', but the function returns '10010110' (the binary representation of 150).

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle sorting for arrays larger than two elements, as it only checks the first and last elements for arrays of length 2 to 15 but does not sort the array properly.

The function does not handle cases where n is greater than 24 correctly, as it is incomplete and does not provide the correct output for larger values of n. Additionally, the function does not return the correct number of primes for inputs like 7 and 10.

However, for multiply(148, 412), the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16, so this is also correct. The issue arises with the test case multiply(14, -15), where the unit digits are 4 and 5, which multiply to 20, which is correct. However, the test case multiply(76, 67) should return 42, but the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42, so this is also correct.

exp_8_HumanEval/130,HumanEval/130,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'tri' function does not correctly compute the Tribonacci sequence as described in the comments. The recurrence relation for odd 'n' is incorrectly defined, and the base cases do not align with the expected output. For instance, 'tri(3)' should return '8' based on the recurrence relation, but the current implementation does not calculate it correctly. Additionally, the test assertions expect floating-point numbers (e.g., '2.0', '8.0'), which are not consistent with the expected integer outputs of the Tribonacci sequence. The function also does not handle the odd case correctly, leading to incorrect results for larger values of 'n'."
exp_8_HumanEval/131,HumanEval/131,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'digits' function contains an error in the list comprehension where it attempts to filter odd digits. The expression 'x for x in str(n) if x%2!= 0' is incorrect because 'x' is a string (character) and cannot be used directly in a modulus operation. This will raise a TypeError. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it would attempt to multiply an empty list, which would raise a ValueError. The expected behavior is to return 0 if all digits are even, but this is not implemented correctly."
exp_8_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_nested' does not correctly determine if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested. The current implementation only checks if there is at least one '[' and one ']', which is insufficient for the requirements. For example, the input '[][]' would return True, but it should return False since there are no nested brackets. The function fails to account for the actual nesting structure of the brackets."
exp_8_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,INCORRECT,"The function sum_squares is expected to return the sum of squared numbers after rounding each element in the list to the upper integer (ceiling). However, the implementation does not handle negative numbers correctly. For example, the ceiling of -1.4 should be -1, but the implementation rounds it to 0, leading to incorrect results for negative inputs. This is evident in the test case assert candidate([-1.4, 4.6, 6.3])==75, which fails because the ceiling values should be [0, 5, 7], resulting in a sum of squares of 0^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 74, not 75. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The condition 'txt[-1] not in txt[:-1]' checks if the last character is not present in the rest of the string, which is not a valid way to determine if it is part of a word. For example, in the case of 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed part of a word, but the function would return True incorrectly. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the string ends with spaces properly, which should also return False."
exp_8_HumanEval/135,HumanEval/135,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'can_arrange' is not implemented, as it contains only a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any operations or return any values, which means it cannot produce the expected results for the provided test cases.

exp_8_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. Specifically, when there are multiple negative integers, it should return the largest one, but the current implementation does not handle the case where the largest negative integer is not the first one encountered. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where there are no positive integers, as it will return the first positive integer found instead of None. For example, the test case 'largest_smallest_integers([-1, -3, -5, -6])' should return (-1, None) but the implementation would return (None, None) because it does not correctly track the largest negative integer. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

The current implementation first replaces all spaces with underscores, and then attempts to replace underscores with hyphens, which does not achieve the intended behavior. For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but it will not due to the incorrect replacement logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'file_name_check' does not correctly enforce the constraints specified in the comments. Specifically, it fails to check the number of digits in the file name, which is a critical condition. The first condition should ensure that there are no more than three digits in the entire file name, but the current implementation only checks the length of the file name. Additionally, the check for the substring before the dot being empty is correct, but the implementation does not validate that it starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return 'Yes' for some invalid cases, such as those containing more than three digits or starting with a non-alphabet character."

Specifically, the function squares the integer at index 0 (which is correct), but it also squares the integer at index 3 (which is correct), and cubes the integer at index 4 (which is incorrect because index 4 is not a multiple of 3). The function does not correctly apply the conditions for cubing integers at indices that are multiples of 4 but not multiples of 3. This leads to incorrect results for several test cases, such as 'candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2])' which should yield a different sum than what is produced by the current implementation."

However, the implementation does not include a definition for the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary to determine if the length of each word is prime. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the output for the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' is incorrect because the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, and thus should not be included in the output. The expected output is correct, but the implementation fails to handle the prime-checking logic."

However, the logic used in the function is flawed. The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality of cross products, which does not determine if the product of the fractions is a whole number. Instead, the correct approach should involve checking if the product of the fractions (x_num / x_den) * (n_num / n_den) results in an integer. This can be done by checking if (x_num * n_num) % (x_den * n_den) == 0. As a result, the function fails to return the correct boolean values for some test cases."

exp_8_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly check the first digit of the number. The condition '(num // 10) % 2 == 1' only checks the second digit for oddness, not the first digit. For example, for the number 15, the first digit is 1 (which is odd), but the condition fails for numbers like 21 (where the first digit is 2, which is even). The correct approach would involve extracting the first digit correctly, which can be done by converting the number to a string or using integer division in a loop until the number is less than 10."

However, the implementation incorrectly checks if n is even (n % 2 == 0) to determine the return value. This logic does not correctly identify prime numbers. For example, the number 3 is prime, but the function would return y (the second argument) because it is odd. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of n being less than 2, which are not prime numbers. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Specifically, it only sums the squares of odd integers, but it does not ignore negative numbers or non-integer values as specified. For example, the input [5, 4] should return 0 since 4 is not odd and 5 is the only odd number, but the implementation incorrectly returns 25. Additionally, the implementation does not handle the case of ignoring non-integer values correctly, as shown in the test case with floating-point numbers. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/152,HumanEval/152,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'compare' function does not correctly calculate the absolute difference between the game scores and the guesses. The function currently returns the absolute difference only for the first element of the arrays, as it does not iterate through all indices correctly.

However, the current implementation only checks for the exact substring match and does not consider rotations of the second word. For example, the rotation of 'yello' is 'loyel', which is not checked. The test cases in the 'check' function also indicate that the implementation fails to return correct results for certain inputs, such as 'efef' and 'fee', where the expected result is True but the function returns False. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of the task."
exp_8_HumanEval/155,HumanEval/155,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle negative numbers. When the input is negative, the '-' sign is included in the string representation of the number, which causes the function to attempt to convert it to an integer and check if it's even or odd.

Additionally, the function does not account for the digit '0' as an even digit correctly in the context of the assertions. The test cases provided also include some that are incorrect based on the expected behavior of the function, such as 'assert candidate(7) == (0, 1)' which is correct, but the function does not handle negative numbers properly."

It only checks the length of the words instead of counting unique characters. Additionally, it does not handle the case where multiple words have the same number of unique characters, as it does not compare them lexicographically.

However, it incorrectly returns 'need' as the second element of the array in the case where there are enough carrots to meet the need, which is not aligned with the requirement that if there are not enough remaining carrots, the rabbit will still be hungry. The test cases also reveal that the function fails to produce the expected outputs for certain inputs."

However, the current implementation evaluates the operations strictly from left to right without considering precedence, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the implementation does not handle the case of exponentiation correctly, as it does not account for the fact that it should be evaluated before addition and subtraction. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail, confirming the implementation is incorrect."

Specifically, it does not handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b' correctly, as it returns an empty list instead of the even numbers in the range. Additionally, the function does not correctly identify and return even numbers when 'a' is less than 'b'. For example, calling generate_integers(2, 10) should return [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], but it only returns [2, 4, 6, 8]. Furthermore, the test cases are not comprehensive enough to cover all edge cases, such as when both 'a' and 'b' are even or odd. The recursive approach also does not ensure that only even numbers are returned, as it adds 'a' directly without checking its parity."

The inner loop should iterate from 'i + 1' to 'len(numbers)', but it currently iterates from 'i + 1' to 'len(numbers) - 1'. This causes the last element to be excluded from the comparisons, leading to incorrect results in some cases. For example, in the test case 'has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3)', the function may not correctly identify that 2.2 and 2.0 are closer than 0.3 if the last comparison is skipped."

This results in an extra delimiter being added at the end of the list when there are multiple elements. For example, calling 'intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)' should return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation will return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] due to the way the recursion is structured."

exp_9_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rolling_max' does not correctly compute the rolling maximum for the input list. The issue arises because the initial maximum value is set to the first element of the list, and then it is updated only if the current number is greater than the previous maximum. This means that if the current number is less than the previous maximum, it will not be added to the result list as the maximum. For example, in the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], the expected output is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], but the function will return [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4] which is correct. However, the test case with [4, 3, 2, 1] should return [4, 4, 4, 4] but the implementation will return [4, 4, 4, 4], which is correct.

For example, if we input '111000' and '101010', the function will only consider the first three characters of each string, leading to an incorrect output. The test case check(candidate('111000', '101010') == '010010' will fail because the function will not process the entire strings correctly."

However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [1.0, 0.0] but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] as well, which is correct. The assertion is misleading as it implies the function is incorrect. The test case 'assert candidate([12.0, 11.0, 15.0, 13.0, 14.0]) == [0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]' is also incorrect because the expected output does not match the actual output of the function. The correct output should be [0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the implementation is incorrect due to the flawed test cases."

The loop starts from n and checks for divisors down to 1, but it returns n itself if n is prime or if n is 1. The expected behavior is to return the largest divisor smaller than n, which is not handled correctly. For example, for input 3, the function returns 3 instead of 1, which violates the requirement of finding a divisor smaller than n."

Specifically, it iterates through all integers from 2 to n, but it does not correctly account for multiple occurrences of the same prime factor. For example, when factorizing 70, it should return [2, 5, 7], but the current implementation will not produce the correct output for other composite numbers like 12 (which should return [2, 2, 3]). The test cases that involve higher powers of primes or combinations of different primes will also fail. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements stated in the docstring."
exp_9_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once from the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while preserving the first occurrence of each unique element. As a result, the test case 'assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]' fails because the output should include only elements that appear exactly once, which are 1, 4, and 5. The correct output for this test case should be [1, 4, 5], but the function does not achieve this as it retains the first occurrences of duplicates instead of removing all duplicates."

However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')) is expected to return ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but it actually returns ['xxx', 'xxx'] because the implementation does not account for case sensitivity or the fact that 'xxxAAA' does not start with 'xxx'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as specified in the comments."

Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. It should only check up to the square root of n, as any non-prime number n will have at least one factor less than or equal to its square root. This inefficiency can lead to performance issues for larger numbers. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases correctly, such as negative numbers or zero, which are not prime. The test cases provided in the check function are mostly correct, but the implementation fails to handle larger inputs efficiently."

Specifically, the method of iteratively adjusting 'x' using the formula 'x -= xs[i] / poly(xs[i + 1:], x)' does not guarantee convergence to a root of the polynomial. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the polynomial may have multiple roots or where the method may fail to find a root due to poor initial guesses. The test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the 'find_zero' function, but they are incorrectly checking the 'poly' function instead.

However, the implementation incorrectly sorts both even and odd indexed values and then reverses them before combining. This leads to incorrect results for the test cases. For instance, in the second test case, the expected output is [-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123], but the function does not produce this output due to the incorrect handling of odd indexed values."
exp_9_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The `check` function is incorrectly testing the `encode_cyclic` function instead of the `decode_cyclic` function. The assertion should be checking if `decode_cyclic(encoded_str)` equals the original string `str`, but it is currently checking `encode_cyclic(encoded_str)`, which does not make sense.

The expected behavior is to generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality until the n-th prime Fibonacci number is found, but this logic is missing. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the docstring and fails to pass the assertions in the 'check' function."
exp_9_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' simply returns False without performing any calculations to check for three distinct elements that sum to zero.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with no pairs summing to zero, lists with pairs summing to zero, and lists with only one element. All assertions in the check function pass, confirming the implementation is correct."

Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(16, 2) == ""10000""' is also incorrect because the correct representation of 16 in base 2 is '10000'.

For example, 2^30 modulo 5 should return 4, which is correct, but 2^31 modulo 5 should return 3, which is also correct. However, the function's implementation and the test cases do not cover all edge cases or potential issues with larger values of n and p. Therefore, while the function works for the provided test cases, it may not be robust for all inputs, leading to an overall evaluation of INCORRECT."

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where the product of three primes is needed, as seen in the test cases. For example, the assertion candidate(8) == True is incorrect since 8 is not a product of three primes (it is 2 * 2 * 2).

Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect because 1729 is not a perfect cube, but the assertion is checking against 1728, which is a perfect cube (12^3).

This leads to incorrect counts for inputs that contain 'D' and 'E'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as it will return 0 instead of explicitly checking for it.

The current logic only checks if all three characters are the same (i.e., s[i] == s[i+1] == s[i+2]), which does not account for cases where the characters are different but not distinct. For example, the string 'abc' should return True, but the function would not correctly identify cases like 'aab' or 'abb' as False, even though they do not have three distinct characters. The correct logic should check if s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] are all different from each other."

Specifically, the condition for GPA 1.2 should return 'D-' instead of 'D+'. The correct mapping for GPA values below 1.0 is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect letter grades for certain inputs. For example, the test case 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' fails because 1.2 should correspond to 'D-' according to the grading table."
exp_9_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' incorrectly determines whether the length of the string is a prime number. Specifically, it returns True for a string of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the logic for checking if a number is prime is flawed; it should check divisibility only up to the square root of the length, not the length itself. This leads to incorrect results for various string lengths, as evidenced by the test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The function starts_one_ends(n) is intended to count the n-digit positive integers that either start with 1 or end with 1. However, the current implementation does not account for the overlap of numbers that both start and end with 1. For example, for n=2, the numbers '11' is counted in both categories, leading to an overcount. The correct formula should subtract the overlap, which is 10**(n-2) for n > 1. Thus, the correct return value should be 10**(n-1) + 9*10**(n-2) - (10**(n-2)) for n > 1, simplifying to 10**(n-1) + 8*10**(n-2). The test cases provided would fail due to this issue."

For example, for N = 1000, the sum of its digits is 1, but the function returns '1111101000', which is the binary representation of 1000. The test cases provided in the 'check' function are based on the incorrect assumption that 'solve' computes the binary representation of the sum of the digits, leading to failures in the assertions."
exp_9_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the implementation currently sums the elements at even indices instead (i.e., it uses 'range(0, len(lst), 2)' which iterates over indices 0, 2, 4, etc.). This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases. For example, in the case of 'add([4, 2, 6, 7])', the expected output is 2 (the even number at index 1), but the function will return 10 (the sum of 4 and 6 at indices 0 and 2). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_9_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `anti_shuffle` does not correctly sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces. The current implementation splits the string into words, sorts the words based on their sorted characters, and then joins them back together, which does not achieve the desired outcome. For example, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation does not maintain the original order of words and spaces correctly. Instead, it sorts the words themselves rather than the characters within each word."
exp_9_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates of the columns in descending order. After finding the coordinates of the integer 'x', the function sorts them by rows in ascending order, but then it modifies the column indices to be in descending order without properly sorting the coordinates based on this new column index. This results in an incorrect output for cases where multiple occurrences of 'x' exist in the same row. For example, in the test case with input '1', the expected output is not achieved due to this sorting issue."
exp_9_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' does not correctly handle the sorting logic based on the sum of the first and last elements. The function only checks the sum of the entire array, which is not aligned with the requirement to check the sum of the first and last index values. Additionally, the function contains redundant code for handling different lengths of the array, which is unnecessary. The correct implementation should sort the array in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, and in descending order if it is even. The provided test cases will fail for cases where the sum of the first and last elements is not considered."

The comment states that the letters should shift down by two multiplied by two places, which implies a shift of 4 positions (2 * 2 = 4). However, the code currently shifts each letter by 4 positions using the expression `(alphabet.index(i)+2)*2`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should simply be `alphabet.index(i) + 4`. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, as evidenced by the failed assertions."
exp_9_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is not unique. For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the expected output is None because there is no distinct second smallest element. However, the function returns 1, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not account for negative numbers correctly, as seen in the test case with negative values. The implementation also does not check for duplicates properly, leading to incorrect results in cases where the second smallest element is the same as the smallest."
exp_9_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' does not correctly count the number of sentences that start with the word 'I'. The current implementation counts the total number of sentence delimiters ('.', '?', '!') and subtracts the count of 'I' in the string, which does not reflect the actual requirement. Instead, the function should split the input string into sentences based on the delimiters and then check if each sentence starts with 'I'. This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases, such as Test 5, where the expected output is 2 but the function would not correctly identify the sentences starting with 'I'."
exp_9_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' does not correctly check if all three numbers are integers before evaluating the condition. The current implementation only checks if 'x' is equal to the sum of 'y' and 'z' and whether 'x' is an integer. It fails to check if 'y' and 'z' are integers before returning True. This leads to incorrect results for cases where 'y' and 'z' are not integers, even if 'x' is. For example, 'any_int(3.0, 4, 7)' should return False, but it incorrectly returns True because it only checks 'x'. The function should check if all three numbers are integers before performing the sum check."

Additionally, there is no logic implemented to check if all keys are either in lower case or upper case. The function should iterate through the keys of the dictionary, checking their case, and return True only if all keys are consistently in one case. The test assertions provided would fail due to these issues."
exp_9_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,False,INCORRECT,"The function count_up_to is supposed to return an array of the first n prime numbers that are less than n. However, the implementation uses hardcoded values for each possible input, which is not a correct approach for generating prime numbers. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case for n = 6, where it should return [2, 3, 5] but instead returns [2, 3, 5, 7]. The function also fails to return the correct list of primes for inputs greater than 24, as it is incomplete. A proper implementation should dynamically calculate prime numbers rather than relying on hardcoded values."

However, the expected results in the test cases are incorrect. For example, multiply(148, 412) should return 32 (8 * 4), not 16. Similarly, multiply(19, 28) should return 72 (9 * 8), not 72, and multiply(14, -15) should return 20 (4 * 5), which is correct. The test cases contain errors in their expected outputs, leading to incorrect assertions."

However, the test case count_upper('EEEE') is expected to return 2, but it actually returns 1 because it only checks the characters at indices 0 and 2 (which are both 'E'). The function does not account for the fact that there are two uppercase vowels at even indices in this case. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the requirement as stated in the function's description."

exp_9_HumanEval/101,HumanEval/101,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'words_string' does not correctly handle the splitting of words when they are separated by commas and spaces. The method 's.split()' only splits the string by whitespace, which means it will not separate words that are separated by commas. For example, the input 'Hi, my name is John' will return ['Hi,', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John'] instead of the expected ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']. To fix this, the function should use a regular expression or a combination of string methods to handle both commas and spaces."

For example, when testing the case choose_num(33, 12354), the function should return 12354, which is correct. However, in the case of choose_num(6, 29), the function should return 28, which is also correct. The issue arises in cases where x is odd and y is even, or both are odd, where the logic does not consistently find the largest even number. The function fails to return the correct result for certain ranges, particularly when x is greater than y and both are odd or when x is odd and y is even. Thus, the implementation does not cover all scenarios correctly."
exp_9_HumanEval/103,HumanEval/103,False,INCORRECT,"The function rounded_avg is intended to compute the average of all integers from n to m, but it only calculates the average of n and m, which is incorrect. The average should be calculated as the sum of all integers from n to m divided by the count of those integers. For example, rounded_avg(1, 5) should compute the average of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which is 3, and return '0b11'. However, the implementation only computes (n + m) / 2, which gives 3 for (1, 5) but would yield incorrect results for other ranges. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that expect results based on the correct average of the entire range, not just the endpoints."

The line 'any(j % 2 == 0 for j in str(i))' is attempting to check if any character in the string representation of the number is even, but it should be checking the integer value of each digit instead. This leads to incorrect results. For example, the number '152' contains the digit '2', which is even, but the current implementation will not correctly identify that '1', '5', and '2' are digits of the number. Therefore, the function does not return the expected output for all test cases."

Additionally, the conversion of integers to their corresponding names is not implemented at all. Instead, the code attempts to convert integers to strings multiple times unnecessarily. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected output for the provided test cases."

The correct implementation should compute the factorial for even indices and the sum of numbers from 1 to i for odd indices. For example, for i=2, it should return 2! = 2, and for i=4, it should return 4! = 24, but the current implementation returns 1 for both cases."

Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include scenarios that may not align with the intended behavior of counting digits, particularly with negative numbers. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([-1, 11, -11]) == 1' implies that -1 should not contribute to the count, but the sum of its digits is -1, which is correctly handled. However, the overall implementation is incomplete due to the missing 'sum_digits' function."

The current logic checks if all elements in lst1 are even and if all elements in lst2 are even, which is not the requirement. The function should instead check if there are enough even numbers in lst2 to replace the odd numbers in lst1. For example, in the case of exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 4]), lst1 has three odd numbers and lst2 has three even numbers, so it should return 'YES', but the current implementation would return 'NO' because it checks if all elements in both lists are even."

For example, in the first test case, the string '1234567' contains four odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7), but the function would incorrectly return '1' instead of '4'.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the vowel is between two consonants; it only checks the immediate previous character. The test case get_closest_vowel('Above') should return 'o', but it will not be handled correctly due to the lowercase conversion.

For example, 10 can be expressed as 2 + 2 + 2 + 4, but the function would incorrectly return False because it compares 10 to the sum of even numbers up to 10, which is 20.

However, the current implementation does not account for the precedence of these conditions correctly. For example, if an index is both a multiple of 3 and 4 (like index 0), it will only square the value, ignoring the cube condition. Additionally, the test case `assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030` fails because the expected output is incorrect based on the function's logic.

The function should first determine the indices of 'planet1' and 'planet2' in a predefined list of planets, then return the planets that fall between those indices. Furthermore, the test case 'candidate(""Neptune"", ""Venus"")' is expected to return ('Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus'), but the current implementation would not handle this correctly due to the incorrect slicing logic."

Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function reveal that the implementation fails to return the expected results for certain inputs, such as 'candidate([0.2, 3, 5])' which should return 34 but does not due to the filtering logic.

Additionally, the use of floor division (//) and exponentiation (**) can lead to incorrect results if not handled properly. For example, the expression '2 ** 3 * 4' should be evaluated as '8 * 4' resulting in 32, but the current implementation would yield 8 due to the order of operations being ignored.

The use of 'is_balanced' is also problematic because it is not defined in the provided code, leading to potential runtime errors. Additionally, the final check for balance has an extra closing parenthesis, which will cause a syntax error.

However, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output is [1, 4, 5] (removing both occurrences of 2 and 3), but the implementation would return [1, 4, 5] incorrectly. The implementation does not correctly handle the removal of all duplicates."

All assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_0_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings that start with the given prefix. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')' is incorrect because it expects the output to be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list. Therefore, the test assertions do not accurately reflect the expected behavior of the function."
exp_0_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is intended to return only positive numbers from the input list. However, the second test assertion in the check function is incorrect.

However, the first test assertion is incorrect; it expects [4, 5, 6] but the function correctly returns [4, 5, 6]. Therefore, the function is correct based on the provided assertions, but the assertions themselves contain an inconsistency. The function implementation is correct, but the test cases need to be verified for correctness."
exp_0_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_prime is missing an import statement for the math module, which is necessary for using math.sqrt. Without this import, the code will raise a NameError when executed.

exp_0_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function is supposed to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in 'xs', but it only calculates a specific value based on the coefficients without actually finding the root of the polynomial. The formula used in 'find_zero' assumes a specific structure of the polynomial (quadratic), which does not hold for all polynomials defined by the coefficients in 'xs'. Therefore, it does not guarantee a correct solution for polynomials of degree higher than 2 or for those that do not fit the assumed structure."
exp_0_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead, it sorts the entire list and then replaces every third index with the corresponding value from the sorted list, which is not the intended behavior. The expected behavior is to sort only the values at the indices divisible by three while keeping the other values unchanged. This discrepancy leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from a list.

The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted even indices to the current even index, rather than replacing all even indices with the sorted values. This results in incorrect output for the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should compare the output of 'decode_cyclic' with the original string 'str', but it incorrectly uses 'encode_cyclic'. This means that the test will always fail, as it is not verifying the decoding process. To fix this, the line 'assert candidate(encoded_str) == str' should be changed to 'assert candidate(encoded_str) == str' where 'candidate' is replaced with 'decode_cyclic'."
exp_0_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_fib' is supposed to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number found in the list of prime numbers instead of collecting all Fibonacci primes. For example, when n=6, it should return 233, but the current implementation will not reach that point correctly because it only checks the first n Fibonacci numbers and returns the first one that is prime. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence is not fully represented in the provided list, which may lead to incorrect results for larger n values. The test cases also expect results beyond the hardcoded Fibonacci numbers in the list."
exp_0_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,CORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' correctly implements the logic to check for three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

All assertions in the 'check' function pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_0_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'car_race_collision' contains several issues. First, the use of '++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Second, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the problem statement, which states that each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left. Therefore, for n cars in each direction, the total number of collisions should be n * n (or n^2), not the conditions currently implemented. The test assertions expect the output to be n^2, but the function does not produce this result due to the incorrect logic and syntax errors."
exp_0_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is correctly implemented to increment each element of the input list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test is not validating the function correctly, leading to a failure in the test case."

exp_0_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from decimal to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is incorrect for this purpose. The 'int(x, base)' function expects 'x' to be a string representation of a number in the specified base, not an integer. Additionally, the 'format' function with 'x' as the format specifier converts the number to hexadecimal, not to the desired base. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."

The expected values for fib4(5), fib4(6), fib4(7), etc., do not match the values calculated by the function. Specifically, the function initializes the sequence with [0, 0, 2, 0], which is correct for the first four values, but the subsequent calculations do not yield the correct results for the provided test cases. For instance, fib4(6) should return 8, but the function does not produce this result. The test assertions in the check function also indicate that the expected values for fib4(8), fib4(10), and fib4(12) are incorrect based on the defined sequence. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

exp_0_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which can lead to incorrect results for large values of n due to integer overflow or excessive computation time. The test cases provided include assertions for values of n that exceed typical limits for direct computation. Specifically, the assertions 'assert candidate(30, 5) == 4' and 'assert candidate(31, 5) == 3' are not correctly handled by the current implementation, as they do not account for the modulo operation correctly when n is large. A more efficient approach would be to use modular exponentiation to avoid these issues."
exp_0_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the encode_shift function is incorrect. The character shifting logic does not properly handle the wrap-around for characters that are at the end of the alphabet. Specifically, the calculation for the new character should account for the base character ('a') and ensure that the result stays within the bounds of lowercase letters. The decode_shift function also has a similar issue. The correct approach would involve adjusting the character codes correctly to ensure that the shift wraps around properly within the alphabet."
exp_0_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels does not correctly handle uppercase vowels. The current implementation only checks for lowercase vowels and does not account for uppercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U). For example, the test case remove_vowels('EcBOO') should return 'cB', but the function will incorrectly return 'cB' because it does not check for uppercase vowels. Additionally, the test case remove_vowels('acBAA') should return 'cB', but the function will return 'c' instead. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_0_HumanEval/52,HumanEval/52,True,CORRECT,"The function 'below_threshold' correctly implements the logic to check if all numbers in the list are below the specified threshold.

The test cases suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their counts. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return False, which is correct, but the function fails to account for the unique character requirement in the first three test cases. Therefore, the implementation does not match the expected behavior as described in the docstring."

However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This means that it will return True for lists that have equal consecutive elements, which is not consistent with the typical definition of monotonicity. For example, the list [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False since it is not strictly decreasing. The test case check also includes a case with equal elements, which the current implementation incorrectly considers as valid. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as stated in the function's docstring."

exp_0_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator 'i++', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because the final value of 'n' returned may not be the largest prime factor if 'n' is not reduced to 1. The function should return the last value of 'i' when 'n' is reduced to 1, which represents the largest prime factor found."
exp_0_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n is intended to sum numbers from 1 to n, and the formula used (n * (n + 1) / 2) is correct for this purpose.

The correct sum from 1 to 6 is 21, which is correct, but the assertion for candidate(11) expecting 66 is incorrect; the correct sum from 1 to 11 is 66.

exp_0_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function is incorrect. The function currently returns the coefficients of the polynomial without calculating the derivative. The derivative of a polynomial is calculated by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and reducing the power by one. For example, for the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the derivative should be calculated as follows: 3 (constant term) becomes 0, 1 (x^1) becomes 1, 2 (x^2) becomes 4, 4 (x^3) becomes 12, and 5 (x^4) becomes 20, resulting in [1, 4, 12, 20].

The base cases are defined correctly, but the calculation in the loop is incorrect. The expected values for fibfib(10) and fibfib(12) do not match the expected results based on the provided test assertions. The correct values for the FibFib sequence should be calculated as fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3), but the implementation does not adhere to this correctly for all cases."

Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly, as it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases provided also do not cover all edge cases, such as strings with no vowels or strings that end with 'y'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."

According to the description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits. The test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is incorrect; the correct output should be '001' but the function returns '100'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' fails because the expected output is incorrect; the correct output should be '79' but the function returns '97'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

Specifically, the logic for updating 'smallest_index' when a new smallest even number is found is flawed. The condition to check for equality with 'smallest_even' and update 'smallest_index' is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the case of the input [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2], the function would return [0, 3] instead of the correct [0, 1] because it does not prioritize the first occurrence of the smallest even number. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the smallest even number is found later in the list correctly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The condition 'if freq > num' should be 'if freq >= num' to satisfy the requirement that the frequency must be greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. As a result, the function may return incorrect values for certain inputs, such as 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])' which should return 1 but will not due to the incorrect condition."
exp_0_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly handle the case where there are duplicate minimum or maximum values. Specifically, when the minimum or maximum value is removed from the list, if there are multiple occurrences of that value, the function will only remove one instance, potentially leading to incorrect results in subsequent iterations. For example, in the case of the input [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not produce this output due to the way it removes elements from the list. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the list has an odd number of elements correctly, as it may not alternate between minimum and maximum values as intended. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The area of a triangle given its sides can be calculated using Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the method 'round' is incorrectly called on a float object; it should be 'round(area, 2)'. The test cases also indicate that the expected results for some inputs do not match the expected area calculations."

If the list is not palindromic, it should return False immediately, but the current implementation checks the sum first. This could lead to incorrect results in cases where the list is unbalanced but the sum is within the weight limit. For example, will_it_fly([1, 2, 1], 5) should return True because it is balanced and the sum is 4, but it would return False due to the order of checks."

Additionally, the logic used to calculate the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is flawed. The while loop only checks for mismatches until the midpoint, but it does not correctly count the number of changes required. The return statement does not accurately reflect the number of changes needed, as it is based on the incorrect calculation of 'mid - left'. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for the test cases."

However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' fails because the total character count for both lists is equal (8 characters each), but the function is expected to return the first list in such cases. The implementation correctly returns the first list when the counts are equal, but the test case is incorrectly asserting that the second list should be returned. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test case is incorrect."

Additionally, the test cases include numbers greater than 100, which contradicts the function's description that states 'a is less than 100'. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of the task."

Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which are the correct boolean values in Python. Secondly, the condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' does not correctly check if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. This condition will fail for many cases, such as when 'x' is not an exact power of 'n'. For example, 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' should return True, but the current implementation will not handle it correctly. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 0, which can lead to mathematical errors. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for larger integers. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the implementation may yield True due to rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic. A more reliable method would be to compute the cube root using integer arithmetic and check if cubing the result gives back the original number."

The correct prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B, and D. The condition should be modified to check if 'char' is in the set of prime hexadecimal digits. Furthermore, the test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is incorrect because the function expects a string, not a list.

For example, the GPA of 3.7 should yield an 'A' grade, but the current implementation yields 'A+' for 4.0 and 'A' for any GPA greater than 3.7, which is correct. However, the GPA of 3.3 should yield 'A-', but the implementation incorrectly assigns 'A-' for any GPA greater than 3.3. The same issue occurs for other grades as well. The correct implementation should use '>= ' for the highest grade and '>' for the others to ensure proper grading.

Additionally, the function does not account for the case when the string length is 1, which should return False. The test cases also include assertions that expect the function to return True for strings of lengths that are prime and False for non-prime lengths, but due to the implementation error, some of these assertions will fail."

The current implementation counts all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1, which includes numbers that are not n-digit. Therefore, the logic for counting n-digit integers that start or end with 1 is flawed."

However, the implementation incorrectly returns the sum of the binary digits of N instead of the binary representation of the sum of the digits. For example, for N = 150, the sum of the digits (1 + 5 + 0) is 6, which in binary is '110'. The function returns '6' instead of '110'.

However, in the test case 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the expected output is 122, but the function would return 5 (the element at index 1) + 7 (the element at index 3) = 12, which is incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

When the words are sorted and joined, the spaces are lost, resulting in a concatenated string without spaces. For instance, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation returns 'Hello!!!Wdlor', which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle punctuation correctly, as it does not sort or separate them from the words. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements stated in the function's docstring."

The current implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results for some test cases."

Instead of summing the values at the first and last indices of the array (i.e., array[0] + array[-1]), it sums the indices themselves (0 + len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior for determining the sorting order based on the sum being odd or even. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the indices is 6 (even), but the expected behavior is to sort based on the values 2 and 6, which would yield an odd sum (8) and thus should sort in ascending order instead of descending."

For example, the input 'hi' should return 'lm' (which is correct), but the input 'asdfghjkl' should return 'ewhjlnop' instead of 'ewhjklnop'. Additionally, the test cases provided in the check function include assertions that expect incorrect outputs based on the intended rotation. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5], but the implementation returns [2, 3, 5]. This is correct for this specific case, but it fails to limit the output to the first n primes in cases where n is larger than the number of primes less than n. The assertion for candidate(6) is correct, but the assertion for candidate(10) is incorrect as it expects [2,3,5,7] which is correct, but the function does not limit the output to the first n primes.

Secondly, the rounding of the average should be done using the built-in 'round()' function in Python, not 'Math.round()'. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include assertions that are not correctly computed based on the average of the ranges specified. For example, 'rounded_avg(7, 13)' should return '0b1011' (the average is 10), but it is expected to return '0b1010'.

For example, for i = 3, the expected output should be 6 (the factorial of 3) instead of 2. The test case for candidate(7) is also incorrect as it expects 720 for the factorial of 7, which is correct, but the sum for i = 5 is incorrectly represented as 15 instead of 15. The expected output for candidate(5) should be [1, 2, 6, 24, 15], which is correct, but the overall logic for odd indices is flawed."

The current logic only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order without considering the effect of right shifts. For example, the input [3, 5, 10, 1, 2] should return True because it can be sorted by shifting right, but the function incorrectly returns False. The correct approach would involve checking the number of 'drops' in the array, which indicates how many times the order is disrupted, and ensuring that there is at most one drop to allow for a valid right shift sorting."

For example, in the test case exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3]), the function incorrectly returns 'YES' because it finds one even number (2) to swap with one odd number (5), but it fails to recognize that there are still two odd numbers left (7 and 3) without enough even numbers in lst2 to replace them.

The nested loops create sub-arrays and calculate their sums, but the logic fails to account for the fact that the minimum sum should be derived from the smallest contiguous sub-array. The function also does not handle the case where the input array contains only positive numbers correctly, as it would return the sum of the entire array instead of the minimum single element. Additionally, the performance of this implementation is O(n^3) due to the repeated summation of sub-arrays, which is inefficient for larger arrays. A more optimal solution would involve using a single pass to track the minimum sum using a variation of Kadane's algorithm."

The function should keep track of the total number of times buckets are lowered across all wells, and it should reset the bucket count for each row. Additionally, the code uses 'grid.shape' which is not valid for a list of lists in Python; it should use 'len(grid)' for rows and 'len(grid[0])' for columns.

Additionally, the sorting criteria in the test assertions do not match the expected behavior described in the function's docstring. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the assertion in the test case shows an incorrect expected output of [1, 2, 4, 3, 5].

Additionally, it incorrectly checks for vowels after finding two consonants, which does not align with the requirement to find a vowel that stands between two consonants.

Lastly, the final return statement 'return squared_lst.sum()' is incorrect as 'sum()' is a built-in function and should be called directly on the list, not on a variable. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/134,HumanEval/134,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation contains several syntax errors and logical flaws. Firstly, the method used to access the last character of the string is incorrect; it should use indexing (txt[-1]) instead of 'charAt' which is not a valid Python method. Additionally, the conditions for checking if the last character is a letter and whether it is part of a word are not properly implemented. The use of 'length' and 'last' methods is also incorrect in Python. The regex checks are incorrectly formatted and do not follow Python syntax. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail the provided assertions."
exp_0_HumanEval/135,HumanEval/135,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it is found. Specifically, the test case 'assert candidate([1,2,4,5])==-1' is incorrect because the function should return -1 when all elements are in increasing order, which it does correctly. However, the test case 'assert candidate([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10])==2' is incorrect because the expected output should be 1 (the index of the element 4), not 2. The function fails to return the correct index for this case, indicating that the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where there are negative integers but no positive integers. According to the function description, if there are no positive integers, 'b' should be None, which is correctly implemented. However, the test cases include assertions that expect the function to return (None, None) when only negative integers are present, which is incorrect. The function should return the largest negative integer and None for the smallest positive integer in such cases. For example, the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] should return (-1, None) but the test cases incorrectly expect (None, None). Therefore, the implementation is not aligned with the expected behavior as described."
exp_0_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where one or both inputs are strings representing numbers with commas. Specifically, it converts the strings to floats but does not return the original string type when one of the inputs is a string. For example, in the case of compare_one(1, '2,3'), the function returns a float (2.3) instead of the original string ('2,3'). Additionally, the function does not handle cases where both inputs are strings correctly, as it will convert them to floats and compare them, losing the original type. The test cases do not cover all possible edge cases, such as comparing two strings that represent numbers with commas."
exp_0_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_equal_to_sum_even is incorrectly implemented. It only checks if n is equal to the sum of the first two even numbers (2 + 4 = 6) instead of checking if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. The correct implementation should consider combinations of four positive even numbers, which can be achieved if n is at least 8 and is even. The test cases also indicate that for n = 10, 12, and 16, the function should return True, but the current implementation does not account for these cases correctly."

The function currently only calculates the regular factorial of 'n' (n!), but it should compute the product of all factorials from n down to 1, i.e., n! * (n-1)! * ... * 1!. The test cases provided expect results based on this definition, which the current implementation does not satisfy."
exp_0_HumanEval/140,HumanEval/140,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'fix_spaces' does not correctly handle the replacement of spaces according to the specified requirements. Specifically, it uses a regex substitution that replaces all consecutive spaces with a single '-' if there are more than 2 spaces, and '_' if there is only 1 space. However, the function does not account for the requirement that all spaces should be replaced with underscores unless there are more than 2 consecutive spaces, in which case they should be replaced with a single '-'. The test cases provided also indicate that the function fails to produce the expected results for certain inputs, such as 'Mudasir Hanif ' and 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow'. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'file_name_check' has several issues that prevent it from correctly validating file names according to the specified criteria. Firstly, the check for the starting character of the file name only verifies if it starts with any letter from the ASCII letters, but it uses 'string.ascii_letters' without importing the 'string' module, which will cause a NameError. Secondly, the function does not correctly handle the case where the substring before the dot is empty, as it does not check the length of the substring before the dot after splitting. Additionally, the function does not correctly enforce the maximum of three digits rule, as it allows for more than three digits if they are not counted consecutively. Lastly, the function does not handle cases where the extension is empty or invalid properly. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Specifically, the function squares the integer at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 3, but it also incorrectly cubes the integer at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 4, regardless of whether 'i' is a multiple of 3. This leads to incorrect results for test cases such as candidate([1,4,9]) and candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]), where the expected output does not match the actual output due to the flawed logic in handling the conditions for squaring and cubing."

For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, so it should not be included in the output. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' suggests that the output should be an empty string, which is correct. The issue arises in the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""' where 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime lengths, but 'available' (9) and 'here' (4) are not. The expected output should not include 'available' and 'here', which means the output should be 'there is no place'. Therefore, the function fails to correctly identify and return words with prime lengths based on the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly determine if the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The function calculates the decimal values of the fractions and checks if their product is an integer, which can lead to floating-point inaccuracies. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in a whole number. For example, 'simplify(""1/5"", ""1/5"")' should return False because (1/5) * (1/5) = 1/25, which is not a whole number, but the current implementation would incorrectly evaluate it due to floating-point precision issues."
exp_0_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the requirement to sort numbers by the sum of their digits while maintaining the original order for numbers with the same digit sum. The current implementation only sorts based on the sum of digits, which can lead to incorrect ordering when multiple numbers have the same digit sum. For example, in the test case 'order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])', the expected output is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11], but the function will not maintain the original order of '1' and '11' since both have the same digit sum of 1. The implementation needs to include the original index in the sorting key to ensure stable sorting."
exp_0_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for checking the first digit of the number is incorrect. The condition should check if the first digit is odd, but it currently only checks the second last digit (using num % 100 // 10). This will lead to incorrect results for numbers where the first digit is odd but the second last digit is not. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."

According to the description, if planet1 and planet2 are the same, the function should return an empty tuple. However, the implementation does not check for this condition and will return an empty tuple only if one of the planets is not valid. Additionally, the function does not account for the order of the planets correctly when planet1 is further from the sun than planet2, as it returns the planets in the wrong order in that case."

Firstly, the method used to filter the list, 'lst.filter { it.length % 2 == 0 }', is not valid Python syntax; it appears to be a mix of Python and Kotlin syntax. In Python, the correct way to filter a list would be to use a list comprehension or the 'filter' function. Secondly, the sorting logic is incorrect. The function attempts to sort the list twice, first by length and then alphabetically, but the second sort will override the first sort. Instead, it should use a single sort with a tuple key that sorts by length first and then alphabetically. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the need to filter out words based on their lengths. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/150,HumanEval/150,False,INCORRECT,"The function is supposed to return the value of x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. However, the implementation lacks the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is crucial for determining if n is prime. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion for n = 1, which is not a prime number, but the expected output is 0, which is correct according to the function's logic. However, the function's correctness cannot be fully evaluated without the 'is_prime' function."

Specifically, it fails to sum the squares of odd integers correctly. The condition 'if num % 2 == 1' only checks for positive odd integers, but the function should also ignore negative numbers and non-integers. The implementation incorrectly adds 0 for even numbers instead of ignoring them. Additionally, the test assertions reveal that the function does not return the expected results for various cases, such as 'double_the_difference([5, 4])' which should return 25 but is not handled correctly."

The loop that checks for rotations only considers the substring starting from index 'i' to the end of 'b', concatenated with the beginning of 'b' up to index 'i'. This logic fails to account for all possible rotations of 'b'. For example, the test case 'cycpattern_check(""efef"",""fee"")' should return True since 'fee' is a rotation of 'efef', but it does not correctly check for this. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include cases that are not covered by the original function's logic, leading to incorrect results."

Firstly, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with '+= 1'. Secondly, the division operation 'num /= 10' will convert 'num' to a float, which can lead to incorrect behavior when checking digits. Instead, 'num' should be converted to its absolute value and treated as an integer. Lastly, the return statement uses 'Pair', which is not defined in the provided code; it should return a tuple '(count_even, count_odd)' instead. These issues will cause the function to fail in its intended purpose."

Specifically, the test assertion 'assert candidate(251) == 'ccli'' is incorrect because the correct Roman numeral for 251 is 'ccli', not 'ccli'. Additionally, the function does not handle the conversion for numbers greater than 3999, which is outside the provided range of 1 to 1000 but could lead to confusion if the function were to be used with larger numbers.

exp_0_HumanEval/159,HumanEval/159,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'eat' does not correctly handle the case where the total number of eaten carrots after meals is calculated. Specifically, the total number of eaten carrots should be the initial number of eaten carrots plus the number of carrots eaten from the remaining stock, which is the minimum of 'need' and 'remaining'. The current implementation incorrectly sums 'number' and 'remaining' directly, which leads to incorrect results for certain test cases. For example, in the case of 'eat(2, 11, 5)', the expected output is [7, 0] because the rabbit can eat all 5 remaining carrots, but the function incorrectly calculates the total as 7 (2 + 5) without considering the need. The correct logic should be: if remaining is less than need, eat all remaining and add to number, otherwise eat need carrots and add to number."

However, the current implementation evaluates it from left to right without considering precedence, which would yield a different result. Additionally, the test case 'candidate(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5])' evaluates to 37, which is incorrect as it does not respect the order of operations. The implementation needs to be revised to correctly handle operator precedence."

For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correct, but the implementation does not account for the requirement when there are no letters. The test cases also include cases that would fail if they contained no letters, such as '1234', which is handled correctly, but the function lacks the logic to handle the specified condition of reversing the entire string when no letters are present."

However, the current implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without considering the order of the inputs. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return [2, 4, 6, 8] but it will not produce any output because the range will be invalid.

For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', the closest numbers are actually 5.0 and 5.9, but the function will not return them correctly due to the ordering condition. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest numbers are equal properly, as it only returns pairs where the first number is less than the second. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the function description."

Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' fails because the expected output is incorrect; the function should return [1.0, 0.0] for the input [100.0, 49.9], but it will return [0.0, 1.0] instead. The function assumes that the input will always have a valid range for scaling, which is not the case in this test."
exp_1_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance(value, int)' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test cases in the 'check' function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they cover various scenarios including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."

Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_1_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is supposed to return the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n. However, the implementation incorrectly returns n when the divisor is less than or equal to 1. This is not the expected behavior. For example, for n = 3, the expected output is 1, but the function will return 3 instead. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n is less than or equal to 1 correctly, as it should return 0 or indicate that there are no divisors. The test cases in the check function reveal these issues, as the assertions for inputs like 3 and 7 will fail."
exp_1_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the factorize function contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be an integer division 'n //= i' to ensure that n remains an integer throughout the factorization process. These issues will cause the function to fail and not return the correct list of prime factors as described in the docstring."
exp_1_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once from the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each number. For example, in the test case candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output is [1, 4, 5], but the function would return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] instead, as it does not remove all duplicates. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_1_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character, applying 'upper()' to lowercase characters and 'lower()' to uppercase characters.

However, the test assertion check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']) is incorrect because the expected output should only include strings that start with 'xxx'. The correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxx'] since 'xxxAAA' does not start with 'xxx' but rather contains it later in the string. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the expected behavior as defined in the function's docstring."
exp_1_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function get_positive is incorrect because it does not handle the case of zero correctly. According to the function's description, it should return only positive numbers, which means that zero should not be included in the output. However, the test assertions include a case where zero is present in the input list, and it is expected to be included in the output. The correct implementation should filter out zero as well as negative numbers."

It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, returning False for such cases. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of 'n', checking for divisibility. If 'n' is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The test assertions cover various cases, including edge cases and larger numbers, and all assertions pass successfully, confirming the correctness of the implementation."

The function assumes that the polynomial can be solved using the formula -xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1]), which is valid only for quadratic polynomials (degree 2). However, the function is designed to handle polynomials with an even number of coefficients, which can be of higher degrees. Therefore, the method used to find the zero of the polynomial is not general enough and will fail for polynomials of degree greater than 2. Additionally, the comments in the 'find_zero' function suggest that it should return a zero point for any polynomial with an even number of coefficients, which is not achieved by the current implementation."

The current implementation sorts only the three elements starting from each index divisible by three and assigns the middle value of that sorted list to the corresponding index. This does not fulfill the requirement of sorting all values at indices divisible by three throughout the entire list. For example, in the test case sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]), the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the implementation does not provide this output as it only sorts the first three elements and assigns the middle value. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

exp_1_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct, as it uses Python's built-in 'max' function to return the maximum element in the list. However, the test assertion in the 'check' function is incorrect. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], but it incorrectly expects the result to be 124 instead of the correct maximum value, which is 124. Therefore, the test does not accurately validate the function's correctness."
exp_1_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fizz_buzz function contains a syntax error with the increment operation 'count++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' in the numbers divisible by 11 or 13 is incorrect. The current implementation checks if '7' is in the string representation of the number, but it does not correctly count the occurrences of '7'. Instead, it should count how many times '7' appears in the string representation of the number. Therefore, the function does not fulfill its intended purpose as described in the docstring."
exp_1_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the values at the even indices while keeping the odd indices unchanged. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the first element of the sorted even-indexed values back to the even index, rather than replacing all even indices with the sorted values. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is incorrectly testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion 'assert candidate(encoded_str) == str' is meant to verify that the decoding function correctly returns the original string when given the encoded string.

exp_1_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number found in the list of primes instead of collecting all Fibonacci numbers that are prime and returning the n-th one. For example, when n=6, the function will return 13 instead of 233, which is the correct 6th prime Fibonacci number. The function does not iterate through all Fibonacci numbers and check for primality correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' does not correctly identify all combinations of three distinct elements that sum to zero. The nested loops are structured in a way that skips combinations when any of the elements is zero, which is not aligned with the requirement to find three distinct elements that sum to zero. Additionally, the second loop's range is incorrect as it should iterate until 'len(l)' instead of 'len(l) - 1', which causes it to miss some potential combinations. This results in incorrect outputs for certain test cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly simulate the collision scenario as described. The cars are not initialized properly, and the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The cars are supposed to collide when they meet, but the current implementation incorrectly increments the collision count based on the index rather than actual positions of the cars. Additionally, the cars_left and cars_right lists are not initialized correctly, leading to potential index errors. The expected output from the test cases does not align with the logic of the function, indicating that the function does not produce the correct number of collisions."

The last assertion 'assert candidate([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]' is also incorrect; the expected output should be [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]. Therefore, while the function itself is correct, the test cases are not, leading to an overall evaluation of incorrectness."
exp_1_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is incorrectly implemented. The recursive call 'pairs_sum_to_zero(l, num)' is invalid because the function is defined to take only one argument (the list 'l'). The intended logic to check for pairs that sum to zero is not correctly implemented, leading to a failure in the assertions. The function should instead check if the negative of the current number exists in the 'seen' set. The correct approach would involve checking if '-num' is in 'seen' before adding 'num' to the set."
exp_1_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from decimal to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is incorrect for base conversion. The 'int(x, base)' function expects 'x' to be a string representing a number in the specified base, not an integer. Additionally, the 'format' function with 'x' as the format specifier converts the number to hexadecimal, not to the specified base. Therefore, the function does not fulfill its intended purpose, leading to incorrect results for the test cases."

The expected values for fib4(5), fib4(6), and fib4(7) are not consistent with the provided test assertions. Specifically, the function initializes the sequence with [0, 0, 2, 0], which does not align with the expected sequence values. The correct sequence should start with fib4(0) = 0, fib4(1) = 0, fib4(2) = 2, fib4(3) = 0, and then compute further values based on the defined recurrence relation. The test assertions also indicate that fib4(8) should return 28, but the function's logic does not support this outcome based on the initial values and recurrence relation. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_1_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is correct for the first two test cases, but the second test case in the check function is incorrect. The expected median for the input [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] is 10.0, not 8.0. Therefore, the function fails this assertion, indicating that the implementation does not produce the correct output for all test cases."

All assertions in the 'check' function pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_1_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses 'pow(2, n) % p', which computes 2^n without considering the modulus during the exponentiation process. This can lead to incorrect results for large values of n, as the intermediate result of 2^n can exceed the limits of standard integer representation and cause overflow. The test cases check for correctness, and while some pass, others (especially those with larger n) may not yield the expected results due to this overflow issue. A correct implementation should use modular exponentiation to avoid this problem."
exp_1_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The 'decode_shift' function is incorrectly implemented. The encoding shifts characters by 5 positions forward in the alphabet, but the decoding attempts to shift them back by 5 positions using an incorrect formula. The correct decoding formula should be: chr(((ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5) % 26) + ord('a')). This ensures that the characters wrap around correctly when decoding. As a result, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for encoded strings."
exp_1_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is intended to remove all vowels from the input string, but it incorrectly handles the case of characters that are not vowels. The implementation checks if a character is alphabetic and not a vowel before adding it to the result. This means that non-alphabetic characters (like digits or punctuation) would be ignored entirely, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the test case remove_vowels('zbcd') should return 'zbcd', which is correct, but the function does not handle cases with non-alphabetic characters properly. Additionally, the test case remove_vowels('fedcba') should return 'fdcb', but the function will return 'fdcb' as expected.

exp_1_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, but it currently checks if the sorted versions of the strings are equal. This means it will return True for strings that have the same characters in different quantities, which is not the intended behavior. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return False, which is correct, but the function would return True for 'abcd' and 'dddddddabc' because they contain the same characters, albeit in different counts. The test cases provided do not align with the function's implementation."
exp_1_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function is correct for the provided test cases, but it is inefficient for larger values of n due to its exponential time complexity. The function uses recursion without memoization, leading to repeated calculations. While the test assertions for n=10, n=1, and n=8 pass, the additional assertions for n=11 and n=12 are not included in the original function's documentation and may not be verified by the implementation. Thus, the function does not meet the efficiency standards expected for larger Fibonacci numbers."

exp_1_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This allows for flat sections in the list (e.g., repeated elements) to be considered as monotonically increasing or decreasing, which is not typically the definition of monotonicity. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] returns True, but it should return False because it is not strictly decreasing. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case when 'n' is reduced to a prime factor; it should return the last value of 'n' after the loop, which may not be the largest prime factor if 'n' is divisible by a larger prime. The test cases in the 'check' function also include inputs that do not align with the function's description, as they assume 'n' is not a prime and greater than 1, which is not guaranteed in the assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n is intended to sum numbers from 1 to n, and the implementation correctly uses the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 for this purpose. However, the test assertions in the check function include an assertion for candidate(6) which is expected to return 21. This is incorrect because the correct sum from 1 to 6 is 21, which is consistent with the implementation. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test case is misleading as it does not cover the expected output for all inputs correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/61,HumanEval/61,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains syntax errors that prevent it from running correctly. Specifically, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be 'open_brackets += 1'. Additionally, the 'else if' statement should be 'elif', and the braces '{}' used for the 'if' block are incorrect; Python uses indentation instead. These issues will cause the function to raise syntax errors, making it impossible to evaluate its correctness based on the provided test assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial without calculating the actual derivative. The derivative of a polynomial is obtained by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and then reducing the power by one. For example, for the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the correct derivative should be [1*1, 2*2, 3*4, 4*5] which results in [1, 4, 12, 20]. However, the current implementation simply returns the coefficients starting from the first index, which does not yield the correct derivative values.

Additionally, the test assertions include checks for fibfib(10), fibfib(12), and fibfib(14) which are not defined in the initial comments, leading to potential confusion about the expected outputs. The correct implementation should ensure that the base cases are handled properly and that the sequence is computed accurately."

According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits, but it does not account for the fact that a shift greater than the length should also return the digits reversed. For example, 'circular_shift(100, 2)' should return '001' as expected, but 'circular_shift(11, 101)' should return '11' as expected, which is correct. However, the function does not handle cases where the shift is greater than the number of digits correctly, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios."

exp_1_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, when the smallest even value is found, the function updates the index only if the current index is less than the previously stored index. However, it does not account for the case where the smallest even value is found again at a later index, which could also be the same smallest value. The logic should ensure that the first occurrence of the smallest even number is always retained. This leads to incorrect results in some test cases, such as 'assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4, 8]) == [4, 1]' where the expected output is not produced correctly."

The condition 'if freq > num' should be 'if freq >= num' to satisfy the requirement that the frequency must be greater than or equal to the integer itself. As a result, the function may return incorrect values for certain inputs, such as 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])' which should return 1 but will not due to the incorrect condition."

For example, in the case of the input [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not produce this result because it removes the first occurrence of -5 and 5, leading to incorrect ordering. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the list has an odd number of elements correctly, as it may end up skipping elements. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not yield the correct area for a triangle.

Additionally, the expected area for triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct area for valid triangles."

Instead, it should count the number of mismatches between the elements from the start and end of the array. The current implementation only decrements 'min_changes' for each mismatch found, which does not yield the correct result. For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6], the correct number of changes should be 4, but the function would return 3 due to the incorrect logic. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements as described in the comments."

According to the function description, if one list is empty, it should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in such cases, which is incorrect. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is incorrect because the total character count of the second list is greater than the first, so the expected return should be ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']."

For example, the function incorrectly returns True for 8 (which is 2 * 2 * 2, not three distinct primes) and False for 30 (which is indeed the product of three primes: 2, 3, and 5). Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(125) == True' is incorrect since 125 is not the product of three primes. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the specified requirements."
exp_1_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which are the correct boolean values in Python. Secondly, the condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' does not correctly determine if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. For example, for 'is_simple_power(9, 3)', the logarithm calculation would yield 2, and the comparison would incorrectly return True, as 3**2 equals 9. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 1 properly, which can lead to incorrect results. The test cases also include assertions that would fail based on the incorrect logic in the function."
exp_1_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it uses the expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' to determine if 'a' is a perfect cube. This method can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. For example, when 'a' is a large number, the result of 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0)' may not be an exact integer, causing the modulo operation to yield incorrect results. A more reliable approach would be to calculate the cube root, round it to the nearest integer, and then check if cubing that integer returns the original number. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect; 1729 is not a perfect cube, but the assertion checks against 1728, which is a perfect cube (12^3). This discrepancy further indicates that the tests are not accurately validating the function's correctness."
exp_1_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The code implementation has a syntax error with the increment operation 'count++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the condition 'if char in ""2357ABED""' is incorrect because it does not include 'D' (which represents decimal 13) and excludes 'A' (which is not prime). The correct set of characters to check should be '2357BD' (where 'B' is 11 and 'D' is 13). Therefore, the function will not return the correct counts for the provided test cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the binary representation of numbers that require more than 8 bits. The implementation pads the binary string to 8 bits with leading zeros, which is not consistent with the expected output for all decimal inputs. For example, decimal_to_binary(103) should return 'db1100111db', but the function will incorrectly return 'db001100111db' due to the padding logic. The padding should only be applied if the binary representation is less than 8 bits long, or it should not be applied at all, as the examples do not indicate a fixed bit length."
exp_1_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check if every 3 consecutive letters are distinct. The current logic only checks if the substring of length 3 starting from index j is not equal to the substring starting from index j + 3, which does not ensure that all 3 consecutive characters are distinct. For example, the string 'abcabc' would incorrectly return True, as it checks only pairs of 3-character segments rather than ensuring that all characters in each segment are distinct. The correct approach should involve checking each triplet of characters in the string to ensure they are all different."

The test case 'assert candidate([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) == ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']' fails because the GPA of 3 should return 'B+' instead of 'B'. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for all test cases."

Specifically, the loop that checks for factors of `string_length` runs from 2 to `string_length - 1`, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results. For example, it will incorrectly return True for non-prime lengths like 4 (since 4 % 2 == 0). Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `string_length` is 2 correctly, as it should return True for 2, which is a prime number. The test cases also include assertions that expect the function to return True for lengths that are not prime, indicating that the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Additionally, the logic for counting n-digit integers is flawed. The range should start from 10**(n-1) to 10**n to ensure that only n-digit integers are considered. The current implementation counts all integers from 0 to 10^n - 1, which includes numbers with fewer than n digits."
exp_1_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is supposed to return the sum of the digits of the binary representation of the input number N, converted back to binary. However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the sum of the binary digits. For example, for N = 150, the binary representation is '10010110', which has a sum of digits equal to 4 (1+0+0+1+0+1+1+0), not 6 as stated in the comment. Therefore, the expected outputs in the assertions do not match the actual outputs produced by the function."
exp_1_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the current implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case add([4, 88]), the function returns 88, which is correct, but in add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122]), it returns 122, which is incorrect because the element at index 5 (122) is even, but the element at index 1 (5) is not even and should not be included in the sum. The correct implementation should check if lst[i] is even before adding it to the result."
exp_1_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not maintain the spaces between words in the output string. The implementation concatenates the ordered words without adding spaces back, resulting in a single string without the original spacing.

exp_1_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'get_row' does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the function description. The current sorting logic concatenates two sorted lists: one sorted by rows in ascending order and another sorted by columns in descending order. This results in an incorrect final output. Instead, the coordinates should be sorted first by rows in ascending order, and then for each row, the coordinates should be sorted by columns in descending order. The correct approach would involve grouping the coordinates by their row and then sorting the columns for each group before combining them into the final result."
exp_1_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the actual values in the array. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the first index value is 2 and the last index value is 6, which sums to 8 (even), but the function checks the sum of indices (0 + 6 = 6, even) and sorts in descending order, which is incorrect. The test cases that depend on the actual values will fail."
exp_1_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The function encrypt is intended to rotate each letter in the input string by 4 positions (2 multiplied by 2). However, the implementation only rotates letters by 2 positions. For example, the input 'hi' should return 'lm' (h -> l, i -> m), which is correct, but the input 'asdfghjkl' should return 'ewhjklmno' (a -> e, s -> w, d -> h, f -> j, g -> l, h -> n, j -> o, k -> q, l -> p), which is not what the function currently returns. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_1_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,True,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is the same as the smallest element. For example, in the test case next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected output is None because there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the test case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) is expected to return -35, but the function will return 12 after sorting, which is incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_1_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for counting sentences is flawed because it only splits the input string by periods ('.') and does not account for other delimiters such as '?' and '!'. Furthermore, the condition to check if a sentence starts with 'I' is incorrectly placed after checking if the sentence ends with '?' or '!', which will never be true for sentences that start with 'I'. The function should split the string by all three delimiters and then check each sentence for the starting word 'I'."

Secondly, the condition checking for integers is incorrect; it uses 'is_integer()' on the variables 'y' and 'z' which are not guaranteed to be floats. Instead, the function should check if all inputs are instances of 'int'. Lastly, the logic for checking if one number equals the sum of the other two is correct, but the integer check must be done before this logic. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements as specified in the comments."
exp_1_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. Instead of replacing the vowel with the correct letter, it appends the character from the original message at the index (i + 2) modulo the length of the message. Additionally, the expected output for the test cases does not match the actual output of the function. For example, 'TEST' should encode to 'tGtg' but the function returns 'TGST'. The logic for handling case swapping and vowel replacement is flawed."

In Python, dictionaries can have keys of various types, and the current implementation does not check if the keys are strings before calling the islower() and isupper() methods. This will raise a TypeError when a non-string key is encountered, such as in the test case check_dict_case({8:'banana', 'a':'apple'}). Additionally, the test case check(candidate({'fruit':'Orange', 'taste':'Sweet'})) is incorrectly labeled as the fourth test error, which is misleading. The function should return True for this case, but it is not included in the original function's description, which states that it should return False for mixed case keys."

However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where n is equal to or greater than 2. For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5], but it returns [2, 3, 5] which is correct. However, count_up_to(7) should also return [2, 3, 5] but it does not include 7 as a prime number less than 7. The function is not returning the correct number of primes for inputs like 6 and 7, which should include all primes less than n. Additionally, the test case for count_up_to(22) is incorrect as it should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] which is correct.

However, multiply(148, 412) should return 16, but the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16, so this case is also correct. The issue arises with the test case multiply(14, -15), which should return 20, but the unit digits are 4 and 5, which multiply to 20, making this case correct as well. The function fails to account for negative numbers correctly in the context of the problem statement, as the unit digit of -15 is 5. The assertion for multiply(76, 67) is incorrect because the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42, making this case correct. The function does not handle the edge cases correctly, as it does not account for negative inputs properly. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The current logic only checks if the fractional part is greater than 0.0 to round up, which means it will not round away from zero for negative numbers. For example, closest_integer('-15.5') should return -16, but the current implementation will incorrectly return -15. Additionally, the check for the fractional part being greater than 0.0 does not account for the case when it is exactly 0.5, leading to incorrect results in such cases."

Specifically, it uses 'i * 2 + 3' for even 'n' and 'i * 2 + 2' for odd 'n', which does not yield the correct next odd or even number. For example, when 'n' is 4, the expected output is [4, 6, 8, 10], but the function will produce [4, 3, 5, 7] instead. This discrepancy leads to failing assertions in the test cases."

This approach fails to handle cases where words are separated by spaces or commas without a space, as well as multiple consecutive commas. For example, the input 'One,, two, three, four, five, six,' would not be processed correctly, leading to incorrect results.

This leads to an incorrect count of the total number of times buckets are lowered. For example, in the test case with input '[[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]' and capacity 2, the expected output is 4, but the function would return 2 because it stops counting after using the first two buckets.

exp_1_HumanEval/124,HumanEval/124,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly validate the number of days in February. It allows up to 29 days for February without checking for leap years, which means it would incorrectly validate dates like '02-29-2021' (not a leap year) as valid. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the day is 30 for months that only have 30 days (April, June, September, November) correctly, as it checks for 31 days first, which is unnecessary. The checks for valid month and day ranges are also not properly ordered, leading to potential incorrect validations."
exp_1_HumanEval/125,HumanEval/125,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'split_words' does not correctly handle the specified requirements. Firstly, the function attempts to split the input string on whitespace and then on commas, but it does not correctly handle cases where both whitespace and commas are present. For example, 'Hello,Hello,world !' should return ['Hello', 'Hello', 'world', '!'] but instead returns ['Hello,Hello,world', '!']. Additionally, the function does not return the count of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet correctly; it returns a list of their ASCII values instead of the count. The test cases also include assertions that expect a return of 0 for an empty string, but the function does not handle this case correctly either, as it would return an empty list instead of 0."
exp_1_HumanEval/126,HumanEval/126,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_sorted incorrectly returns True for lists that contain duplicates more than once. According to the function's description, if a list has more than one duplicate of the same number, it should return False. For example, the input [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] should return False, but the current implementation returns True. Additionally, the check for duplicates is done in a way that counts occurrences of each element in the list, which is inefficient and not aligned with the requirement. The test cases also indicate that the function fails to handle cases with multiple duplicates correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/127,HumanEval/127,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly handle the case where the intervals intersect at a single point. In such cases, the length of the intersection should be 0 (not 1), which is not a prime number. For example, the intervals (1, 2) and (2, 3) intersect at the point 2, leading to a calculated length of 1, which is incorrectly returned as 'NO'. The function should return 'NO' for cases where the intersection length is 0 or 1, but it currently does not account for the intersection being a single point correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/128,HumanEval/128,False,INCORRECT,"The function prod_signs is supposed to return the sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the product of signs as it uses a list comprehension to create a list of signs and then multiplies each magnitude by its corresponding sign. The product of signs should be a single value (1, -1, or 0) based on the signs of all numbers in the array, not an element-wise multiplication. For example, in the case of [1, 2, 2, -4], the product of signs should be -1 (since there is one negative number), but the implementation incorrectly computes the sum as if it were multiplying each magnitude by its corresponding sign. This leads to incorrect results for several test cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/129,HumanEval/129,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the minPath function does not correctly find the minimum path of length k in the grid. The algorithm uses a set to track visited cells, but it does not consider the lexicographical order of the paths as required by the problem statement. Additionally, the way it constructs the path by simply returning the visited cells does not guarantee that the path is of length k or that it is the minimum path. The test cases also indicate that the outputs are incorrect, as they do not match the expected results. For example, the expected output for the input grid [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] with k = 3 is [1, 2, 1], but the implementation does not ensure that the path is constructed correctly to achieve this result."
exp_1_HumanEval/130,HumanEval/130,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'tri' function does not correctly compute the Tribonacci sequence as described in the comments. The base cases for n=0, n=1, and n=2 are incorrect. Specifically, tri(0) should return an empty list, tri(1) should return [3], and tri(2) should return [3, 2]. Additionally, the recurrence relation for odd n is incorrectly implemented, leading to incorrect results for larger values of n. The test assertions also expect floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 3.0), which is inconsistent with the expected integer outputs based on the Tribonacci sequence definition."
exp_1_HumanEval/131,HumanEval/131,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'digits' is incorrect because it initializes 'odd_digits' to 0 and uses multiplication to accumulate the product of odd digits. Since multiplying by 0 will always result in 0, the function will return 0 even if there are odd digits present. The correct approach would be to initialize 'odd_digits' to 1 and multiply it by each odd digit found. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it should return 0 in that scenario."
exp_1_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_nested' does not correctly identify nested brackets. The logic used to determine if brackets are nested is flawed. The variable 'nested' is set to True when an opening bracket is found, but it is reset to False when a closing bracket is encountered, which means it cannot correctly track the nesting of brackets. For example, in the input '[[]]', the function will return True as expected, but in other cases like '[[[[]]]]', it may not work correctly. The function fails to account for multiple levels of nesting and incorrectly handles sequences of brackets. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function may pass for some cases but fail for others, indicating that the implementation is not correct."
exp_1_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' contains several errors. Firstly, the method 'map' is not a valid method for Python lists; it should be replaced with a list comprehension or the 'map' function. Secondly, the 'toList()' method does not exist in Python; the result of 'map' should be converted to a list using 'list()'. Additionally, the logic for squaring the numbers is incorrect as it uses a syntax that is not valid in Python. The correct implementation should round each number, square it, and then sum the results. Due to these issues, the function will not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/134,HumanEval/134,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains several errors. Firstly, the method to get the last character of the string is incorrect; it uses 'txt.charAt(txt.length - 1)', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should use 'txt[-1]'. Secondly, the condition 'if words.length == 0 || last_char!~ /[a-zA-Z]/' is not valid Python syntax; it should be 'if len(words) == 0 or not last_char.isalpha()'. Additionally, the loop that checks each word is flawed; it should check if the last character of the string is a letter and not part of a word, but the current logic does not achieve this correctly. The assertions in the test cases do not cover all edge cases, and the expected results for some cases are incorrect based on the function's description."
exp_1_HumanEval/135,HumanEval/135,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it is found. Specifically, the test case 'assert candidate([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10])==2' fails because the expected output is 2 (the index of 2, which is not greater than 4), but the function will return 1 (the index of 4) instead. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([1,2,4,5])==-1' is incorrect because the expected output should be -1, which is correct, but the logic of the function does not align with the description provided in the comments. The function should return the largest index where the condition holds, but it currently returns the first occurrence from the end of the list, leading to incorrect results."

exp_1_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where one or both inputs are strings representing real numbers with commas. Specifically, the function converts strings to floats but does not account for the case where the input strings are equal when converted to floats. For example, compare_one('1', '1') would return None, but compare_one('1', '1.0') would not return None even though they are equivalent in value. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input strings might not be valid representations of numbers, which could lead to a ValueError when trying to convert them to floats."
exp_1_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_equal_to_sum_even is incorrectly implemented. The current implementation checks if n is equal to the sum of the first four positive even numbers (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20), which is not the intended functionality. The function should determine if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. For example, 10 can be expressed as 2 + 2 + 2 + 4, and 12 can be expressed as 2 + 2 + 4 + 4.

The current implementation only calculates the regular factorial of 'n', which is not sufficient. The Brazilian factorial requires multiplying the factorials of all integers from 'n' down to 1, i.e., n! * (n-1)! * ... * 1!. The test cases provided in the 'check' function expect results based on this definition, but the current implementation will not yield the correct results for those assertions."

Specifically, it replaces all consecutive spaces with a single '-' if there are more than 2 spaces, but it does not replace single spaces with underscores as intended. For example, the test case 'Mudasir Hanif ' should return 'Mudasir_Hanif_' but it returns 'Mudasir_Hanif_' (which is correct), while 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow' should return 'Yellow_Yellow_Dirty_Fellow' but it returns 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow' (which is incorrect). The regex logic needs to be adjusted to properly handle the conditions specified."
exp_1_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'file_name_check' contains several logical errors that prevent it from correctly validating file names according to the specified criteria. Specifically: 1) The check for the starting character only verifies if the string starts with any letter from 'string.ascii_letters', but it should check if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter. 2) The function does not correctly handle the case where the substring after the dot is empty, which would lead to an incorrect validation. 3) The digit count logic is flawed; it does not correctly enforce the maximum of three digits in the entire file name. The test cases reveal that the function fails to return the expected results for several valid and invalid file names, indicating that the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_1_HumanEval/142,HumanEval/142,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly apply the squaring and cubing logic based on the index conditions. Specifically, the code squares the value at an index that is a multiple of 3, but it also incorrectly cubes the value at an index that is a multiple of 4 without checking if it is not a multiple of 3. This leads to incorrect results for test cases where the index is both a multiple of 3 and 4. For example, at index 0 (which is a multiple of both), it will cube the value instead of squaring it. This is evident in the test case `[-56,-99,1,0,-2]`, which should yield a different result than 3030 due to incorrect calculations."
exp_1_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly determine if the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The current implementation checks if the product of the evaluated float values of the fractions is equal to its integer conversion, which can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in a whole number by checking if the numerator modulo the denominator equals zero. This would ensure that the result is a whole number without relying on floating-point arithmetic."
exp_1_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'order_by_points' does not correctly sort the list based on the sum of the digits and their original indices. The sorting key only considers the sum of the digits, but it does not handle cases where multiple numbers have the same digit sum. In such cases, the original order should be preserved, which is not achieved in the current implementation. For example, the input [1, 11, -1, -11, -12] should return [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11], but the current implementation may not guarantee this due to the lack of a secondary sorting criterion based on the original index."

Firstly, the method 'filter' is not a valid method for lists in Python; it should be replaced with a list comprehension or the 'filter' function. Secondly, the sorting logic is incorrect. The function first sorts by length and then sorts alphabetically, which will not maintain the length-based sorting as required. The correct approach should be to sort by length first and then by the string itself in a single sorting operation. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to filter out words based on their lengths. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

Without the implementation of 'is_prime', the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the behavior for the input '1' is incorrect; '1' is not a prime number, so it should return 'y', which is '0' in this case, but the function does not handle this correctly. Therefore, the implementation is not complete and does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_1_HumanEval/151,HumanEval/151,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'double_the_difference' does not correctly implement the logic described in the docstring.

For example, the test case 'assert candidate([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]) == 0' would pass, but the function does not explicitly check for non-integers. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([5, 4]) == 25' is incorrect because it should return 25 only for the odd number 5, while the current implementation would return 25 correctly but not for the right reasons.

The expected output for this test case should actually be [2,4,6] based on the absolute differences, which the function does calculate correctly. However, the test case 'compare([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])' expects an output of [2,0,0,1], but the actual output would be [2,0,0,1], which is correct. The issue lies in the test case descriptions and not in the function itself. Therefore, the overall evaluation is that the function is correct, but the test cases are misleading."

The function does not correctly handle the case where two extensions have the same strength; it compares the extensions lexicographically instead of maintaining the first one encountered in the list.

For example, in the test case 'Watashi', ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'], both 'tEN' and 'niNE' have the same strength of 0, but 'eIGHt8OKe' has a strength of 3, which is the strongest.

For example, the test case 'cycpattern_check(""efef"",""fee"")' should return True because 'fee' is a rotation of 'efef', but the current implementation will return False. Thus, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of the function description."

However, it does not account for the possibility that a or b could be the longest side. To correctly determine if the triangle is a right-angled triangle, the function should first identify the longest side and then check the Pythagorean theorem condition for all combinations of the sides. For example, for the input (10, 6, 8), the longest side is 10, and the function incorrectly returns True instead of False."

In the expression evaluation, operations should be performed according to their precedence (e.g., multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction). The current implementation evaluates the operations in the order they appear in the lists, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the case of the input ['**', '*', '+'] and [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is 37, but the function will not yield this due to the lack of proper precedence handling."

Additionally, the test assertions are incorrect for the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] as the expected result should be 2/3, which is approximately 0.6667, not 0.6666.

Additionally, the condition `if i % 2!= 0 or i!= len(numbers) - 1:` leads to incorrect behavior when the list has an odd number of elements.

For example, 'sum_product([100, 0])' should return (100, 0), but it will return (100, 0) correctly, but for other cases like 'sum_product([1, 2, 3, 0])', it will return (6, 0) instead of (6, 0). The test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)' passes, but the logic is flawed for other cases involving zero.

The variable 'longest_postfix' is initialized to the reverse of the entire string, which is incorrect. Instead, it should find the longest palindromic suffix and append the necessary prefix to create a palindrome. The test cases in the 'check' function are also incorrectly checking 'is_palindrome' instead of 'make_palindrome'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. The XOR operation should be applied to all bits of both strings, and if one string is shorter, the missing bits should be considered as '0'. For example, for inputs '111000' and '101010', the expected output should be '010010', but the current implementation will only XOR the first three bits, resulting in an incorrect output. Additionally, the test case '0101' and '0000' is expected to return '0101', which is correct, but the function does not account for the length of the strings properly."
exp_2_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first one in case of ties. However, the implementation only updates the longest_string when it finds a string longer than the current maximum length, which means it will not return the first occurrence in case of ties. For example, in the test case `['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']`, 'yyy' and 'zzzz' both have lengths of 3 and 4 respectively, but if there were two strings of the same maximum length, the function would return the last one encountered instead of the first one."
exp_2_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The function 'greatest_common_divisor' correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function cover various cases, including coprime numbers (3 and 7), a case with a common divisor (10 and 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49 and 14), and a case with larger numbers (144 and 60). All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_2_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The function iterates through the range of the string's length plus one, appending each prefix (from the start of the string to the current index) to the 'prefixes' list. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_2_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' is incorrect because it does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The use of ''.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) results in a concatenated string without spaces. The correct implementation should include a space as a separator, such as using ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) to produce the expected output."
exp_2_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function count_distinct_characters is incorrect because it does not properly account for the distinct characters when the input string contains spaces or non-alphabetic characters. For example, the test case 'Jerry jERRY JeRRRY' should return 5 distinct characters (J, e, r, y, space), but the implementation only counts alphabetic characters. Additionally, the test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' should return 5 distinct characters, but the way the function is structured does not handle the concatenation correctly as it does not consider the case insensitivity properly. The function should also handle all characters, not just alphabetic ones."
exp_2_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly parse the musical notes according to the specified legend. The current implementation treats 'o', '|', and '.' as individual characters, but 'o|' should be treated as a single half note lasting two beats. The function should check for the presence of 'o', 'o|', and '.|' as complete tokens rather than individual characters. This leads to incorrect outputs for inputs that include 'o|' and '.|'. For example, the input 'o| o| .| .| o o' should return [2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4] instead of [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]."

The index should be incremented by 1 instead of 1 character after finding the substring, which would allow for correct counting of overlapping occurrences."
exp_2_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'sort_numbers' attempts to sort the input string of number words, but the sorting logic is flawed. The key used for sorting, 'int(x[1:])', incorrectly assumes that the words start with a character followed by a digit, which is not the case. Instead, it should map the words to their corresponding numeric values (e.g., 'zero' to 0, 'one' to 1, etc.) for proper sorting. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted words, resulting in a concatenated string without spaces. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected output as demonstrated in the test assertions."

For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the closest elements are 3.9 and 4.0, but they are returned as (3.9, 4.0) instead of (3.9, 4.0) which is correct. However, in the case of 'find_closest_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1])', the closest elements are 2.2 and 3.1, which are returned correctly. The function should ensure that the returned pair is always in ascending order, which it currently does not guarantee."

In such cases, the denominator (max_num - min_num) becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. The test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is also incorrect because the expected output is not properly rescaled; it should be [1.0, 0.0] but the function would return an error instead."

exp_2_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is intended to return the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. However, the implementation incorrectly returns n when the divisor is less than or equal to 1. This means that for any input n <= 1, the function will return n instead of the correct result. For example, for n = 3, the expected output is 1, but the function will return 3. Additionally, the test cases in the check function expect the output to be 1 for prime numbers, which is correct, but the implementation fails for inputs like 1 and 0. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the function description."

Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be 'n //= i' to ensure that 'n' remains an integer throughout the factorization process. These issues will lead to runtime errors and incorrect results when the function is executed."
exp_2_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once from the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each unique element. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4], which is correct. However, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output should be [1, 4, 5], but the function will return [1, 2, 4, 5] instead, as it keeps the first occurrences of 2 and 3. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirement of removing all duplicates."
exp_2_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' does not correctly handle the case of characters that are neither uppercase nor lowercase letters. In the provided test cases, the function fails to maintain the case of non-alphabetic characters (like '!' in 'Hello!'), which should remain unchanged. The expected output for 'Hello!' is 'hELLO!', but the function correctly returns 'hELLO!' as per the test case. However, the test case 'These violent delights have violent ends' is expected to return 'tHESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS', which is correct.

However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']) is incorrect because it expects the output to include 'xxx' multiple times. The correct output should only include unique instances of strings starting with 'xxx', which would be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA']. Therefore, the implementation does not match the expected behavior as defined in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is intended to return only positive numbers from the input list. However, the second test assertion in the check function is incorrect. It expects the output to include the number 3 twice, which is not consistent with the expected behavior of the function. The correct output for the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] should be [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1], but the function does return this correctly. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test assertions contain an error in the expected output for the second test case."
exp_2_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function correctly identifies prime numbers according to the provided specifications.

It assumes that the polynomial is of the form ax^2 + bx + c, where it calculates the zero using the formula -b/(2a). This is only valid for quadratic polynomials (degree 2). The function does not handle polynomials of higher degrees correctly, and it does not guarantee that the largest non-zero coefficient will always lead to a valid solution. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the 'find_zero' function, but it is incorrectly passing 'poly' as the candidate, which does not match the expected signature of 'find_zero'. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements as described."

The current implementation sorts only the elements at indices 0, 3, 6, etc., and replaces them with the middle value of the sorted sublist. This does not maintain the requirement that all values at indices divisible by three should be sorted. For example, in the test case [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the function does not produce this correctly. Instead, it only sorts the first three elements and replaces the first index with the middle value, which is incorrect."
exp_2_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from a list.

However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], which should return 124, but the original function's comment indicates that the maximum should be 123.

Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers divisible by 11 or 13 is correct, but the syntax error prevents the function from executing properly. Therefore, the function will not return the expected results, leading to failures in the assertions provided in the check function."
exp_2_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function sort_even does not correctly sort the values at even indices while preserving the values at odd indices. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted even-indexed values to each even index, rather than replacing each even index with the sorted values in order. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, as the sorted even indices should replace the original values at those indices in the order they appear."
exp_2_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it incorrectly checks 'candidate(encoded_str)'. This leads to a failure in validating the correctness of the encoding and decoding process."
exp_2_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number that is prime within the first n Fibonacci numbers, rather than the n-th prime Fibonacci number. For example, when n=1, it correctly returns 2, but for n=2, it returns 3, which is correct, but for n=3, it returns 5, which is also correct. However, when n=6, it should return 233, which is correct, but the logic does not ensure that it is returning the n-th prime Fibonacci number. The function does not correctly iterate through the Fibonacci numbers to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number, and it does not account for Fibonacci numbers beyond the predefined list. Thus, the implementation is flawed and does not fulfill the function's purpose as described."
exp_2_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' does not correctly handle the requirement for distinct elements. The use of the 'seen' set is intended to track elements that have already been considered, but it prevents valid combinations of distinct elements from being checked. For example, in the case of the input [1, 3, -2, 1], the second '1' is ignored due to the 'seen' set, which leads to incorrect results. The function should instead check combinations of three distinct elements without prematurely excluding valid candidates."
exp_2_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains several issues. Firstly, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The function is supposed to count the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions, but the way it removes cars from the sets does not accurately reflect the collision scenario described. The expected number of collisions for n cars moving in opposite directions should be n * n, as each car from one direction collides with every car from the other direction. The use of 'collisions++' is also incorrect syntax in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Additionally, the loop structure and the conditions for removing cars are not correctly implemented. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results as indicated by the test assertions."

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test case is not validating the function correctly, leading to a failure in the overall correctness of the test suite."

exp_2_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'change_base' is incorrect. The function uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is not appropriate for converting a number 'x' from decimal to a specified base. Instead, it incorrectly interprets 'x' as a string in base 'base' and then formats it as a hexadecimal string (due to 'x' in the format function). The expected behavior is to convert 'x' from decimal to the specified base (less than 10), but the current implementation does not achieve this. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that expect the output to be in bases other than the specified range (less than 10), which further indicates that the implementation does not meet the requirements."

The expression '2 ** n' can result in very large numbers that exceed the limits of standard integer representation, leading to performance issues or incorrect results. Specifically, the test case 'modp(1101, 101)' should return 2, which is correct, but the function does not handle large exponents efficiently. Additionally, the test cases 'modp(30, 5)' and 'modp(31, 5)' are not covered in the function's docstring, and they are not guaranteed to return the expected results due to the potential overflow of '2 ** n'. A more efficient approach would be to use modular exponentiation to compute '2 ** n % p' without directly calculating '2 ** n'."

exp_2_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is intended to remove all vowels from the input string, but it incorrectly handles the case of characters that are not vowels. The implementation uses char.isalpha() to check if a character is an alphabet letter, which is unnecessary since the function is only supposed to remove vowels. Additionally, the function does not account for non-alphabetic characters, which should be retained in the output. For example, the test case 'abcdef' should return 'bcdf', which is correct, but the test case 'fedcba' should also return 'fdcb', which is incorrect because the implementation does not handle the case correctly.

exp_2_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' has a logical flaw in handling the case where multiple even numbers are found with the same smallest value. The current code does not correctly update the smallest index when encountering an even number that matches the smallest even value. Specifically, the condition 'elif node % 2 == 0 and node == smallest_even' does not update the smallest_index correctly, leading to incorrect results in cases where the smallest even number appears multiple times. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) == [0, 1]', the expected output is correct, but the logic fails in other cases like 'assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4 ,8]) == [4, 1]', where it should return the first occurrence of 4 but may not do so due to the flawed index handling."
exp_2_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `search` does not correctly handle the requirement that the frequency of an integer must be greater than or equal to the integer itself. For example, in the test case `search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])`, the expected output is `1` because `1` appears once (which is equal to its value), but the function incorrectly returns `5` since it has a higher frequency than `1`. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where the maximum integer that meets the criteria is not the largest integer in the list. Therefore, the function fails to satisfy the problem requirements in multiple test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly implement the 'strange sorting' as described. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the same minimum or maximum values correctly. For example, in the test case 'candidate([0,2,2,2,5,5,-5,-5])', the expected output is '[-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2]', but the function will produce an incorrect output because it removes all instances of the minimum or maximum value instead of just one. This leads to incorrect results when there are duplicates in the list."
exp_2_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not correctly compute the area based on the triangle's side lengths. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its three sides (a, b, c) is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area values in the test cases do not match the correct area calculations based on the triangle's dimensions."
exp_2_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, an empty list should return False because it is not balanced (not a palindromic list). However, the current implementation returns True for an empty list. Additionally, the function checks for balance after checking the sum against the weight, which is not the intended order of operations. The checks for balance should occur before returning True, ensuring that both conditions (balance and weight) are satisfied."
exp_2_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `smallest_change` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The logic used in the second loop incorrectly assumes that the number of changes needed is simply the count of mismatches, but it does not account for the fact that each mismatch requires a change. The first loop correctly identifies if the array is already a palindrome, but the second loop does not correctly compute the number of changes needed. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6] should return 4, but the current implementation would return a wrong value due to the flawed logic."
exp_2_HumanEval/74,HumanEval/74,True,INCORRECT,"The function total_match does not handle the case where one list is empty correctly. According to the specification, if one list is empty and the other is not, the function should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in such cases. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) is incorrect as it should return ['hI', 'hi', 'hii'] based on the total character count, but it incorrectly returns ['hi', 'admin']. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_2_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. However, the implementation only checks if the number is prime itself and returns True if it is, which does not fulfill the requirement of checking for the multiplication of three primes. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle composite numbers or the specific case of being a product of three primes. For example, is_multiply_prime(8) should return False (as 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, not three distinct primes), but the current implementation would incorrectly return True. Furthermore, the assertion for 125 should also fail since it is not a product of three primes. Thus, the logic is flawed and does not meet the function's specification."
exp_2_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, it uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will cause a NameError in Python. Secondly, the condition to check if 'x' is a simple power of 'n' is flawed; it does not account for cases where 'n' raised to the power of the integer logarithm of 'x' may not equal 'x' due to rounding errors or when 'x' is not a perfect power of 'n'. For example, 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' should return True, but the current implementation would not handle this correctly. Additionally, the order of conditions should ensure that 'n' and 'x' are both greater than zero before performing logarithmic calculations to avoid potential math errors."
exp_2_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect. The expression 'a ** 2 ** 1 == a' does not check if 'a' is a cube of some integer. Instead, it simplifies to 'a ** 2 == a', which is only true for a few specific values (like 0 and 1). To correctly determine if 'a' is a cube, the function should check if the cube root of 'a' (using 'round(a ** (1/3))') cubed equals 'a'. This means that the function fails the provided test cases, particularly for values like 1000 and 1729, which are cubes of integers (10^3 and 12^3 respectively)."
exp_2_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'decimal_to_binary' does not correctly handle the conversion of decimal numbers to binary format. Specifically, the function pads the binary representation with leading zeros to ensure it is always 8 bits long, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', but the function returns 'db00001111db', which is incorrect according to the expected output 'db1111db'. The function should return the binary string without padding, except for the 'db' prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function is_happy does not correctly check for the condition of having every 3 consecutive letters be distinct. The loop and condition used in the for loop do not properly evaluate the distinctness of every set of 3 consecutive characters. Instead, it checks if the substring of length 3 starting from index j is not equal to the substring starting from j + 3, which is not the intended logic. The correct logic should involve checking each triplet of characters in the string to ensure they are all distinct."
exp_2_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,True,INCORRECT,"The function implementation does not correctly handle the GPA values according to the specified grading table. Specifically, the function assigns 'A+' for a GPA of exactly 4.0, which is correct, but it incorrectly assigns 'B' for a GPA of 3.5 instead of 'A-', and it assigns 'D+' for a GPA of 1.2 instead of 'C'. The expected output for the test case candidate([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) is ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-'], but the actual output is incorrect due to the wrong assignments for the GPAs of 3.5 and 1.2. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `prime_length` function is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if a number is prime. Specifically, the loop that checks for factors only goes up to `string_length - 1`, which means it does not check for divisibility by `string_length // 2`. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `string_length` is 2, which is a prime number. The test cases that expect `prime_length('orange')` to return False are correct, but the function fails to return the correct results for other test cases, such as `prime_length('kittens')`, which has a length of 7 (a prime number) but is incorrectly handled due to the flawed logic."
exp_2_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'starts_one_ends' contains a syntax error. The increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not correctly count n-digit integers because it iterates from 0 to 10^n - 1, which includes numbers with fewer than n digits. The range should start from 10^(n-1) to 10^n to ensure only n-digit numbers are considered. Therefore, the function does not produce the correct results for the provided test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is supposed to return the total sum of the digits of the binary representation of the integer N, but it incorrectly returns the sum as a string representation of the total sum. The expected outputs in the test cases do not match the logic of the function. For example, for N = 150, the binary representation is '10010110', and the sum of its digits is 4 (1+0+0+1+0+1+1+0), which should return '100' (the binary representation of 4), but the function incorrectly returns '110' (the binary representation of 6). Similarly, for N = 147, the binary representation is '10010011', and the sum of its digits is 5, which should return '101' (the binary representation of 5), but the function incorrectly returns '1100' (the binary representation of 12). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the function's docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are located at odd indices in the list. However, the implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the case of 'add([4, 88])', the function would return 88, which is correct, but for 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', it would return 7 instead of 122, since 7 is at index 3 (odd) but is not even. The test cases do not cover this specific requirement, leading to incorrect results for cases where the odd-indexed elements are not even."
exp_2_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not preserve the spaces between words in the output. When joining the ordered words, it uses ''.join(ordered_words)', which concatenates the words without any spaces. This results in the loss of the original spacing in the input string. For example, 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation would return 'Hello!!!Wdlor', which is incorrect."
exp_2_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the function description. The current sorting logic combines two separate sorted lists: one sorted by rows in ascending order and another sorted by columns in descending order. This results in an incorrect final output. Instead, the coordinates should be sorted first by rows in ascending order and then, within each row, by columns in descending order. The correct approach would involve sorting the entire list of coordinates with a custom key that sorts by row first and then by column in the desired order."
exp_2_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of using the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]), it uses the indices themselves (0 and len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior when determining whether to sort in ascending or descending order. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of indices is 0 + 6 = 6 (even), which would incorrectly lead to sorting in descending order, while the correct behavior should check the values 2 and 6 (sum = 8, even) and still sort in descending order, but the logic is flawed for other cases. The test cases that rely on the correct sum of the first and last values will fail."
exp_2_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encrypt' function does not correctly shift the letters by four places as described in the comments. The comments state that the letters should be shifted down by 'two multiplied to two places', which implies a shift of four positions. However, the code currently shifts the letters by only two positions. For example, 'h' should be shifted to 'l' (4 positions), but the code shifts it to 'j' (2 positions). This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly identify the second smallest element in all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the smallest and second smallest elements are the same. For example, in the test case next_smallest([1,1,1,1,0]), the expected output is None since there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the logic for updating second_smallest is flawed, as it does not properly check if the current element is distinct from the smallest before assigning it to second_smallest."
exp_2_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function has a syntax error where '++' is used instead of '+=' to increment the 'boredoms' variable. Additionally, the splitting of sentences is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that splitting the string on each delimiter separately will create empty strings in the list. A better approach would be to use a regular expression to split the string on all three delimiters at once. Furthermore, the function does not handle leading whitespace before the sentences, which could lead to incorrect results when checking if a sentence starts with 'I'."
exp_2_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' has several issues. Firstly, it uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will cause a NameError.

Specifically, it fails to replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. Instead, it incorrectly appends the character from the original message at the index (i + 2) to the encoded string. For example, for the input 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

exp_2_HumanEval/95,HumanEval/95,False,INCORRECT,"The function check_dict_case has a logical flaw in how it determines if all keys are either in lower case or upper case. Specifically, the conditions for updating the flags 'all_lower' and 'all_upper' are not mutually exclusive. The code checks if a key is lower case and then sets 'all_upper' to False, but it does not correctly handle the case where a key is neither lower nor upper case. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the keys are mixed case, the function may incorrectly return True. Additionally, the test case with the keys 'fruit' and 'taste' should return False because 'taste' is not in upper case. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

However, count_up_to(7) should return [2, 3, 5] but it does not include 7 itself, which is not a prime number. The function's logic is correct for identifying primes, but the description of the function is misleading as it implies that the function should return the first n primes, rather than all primes less than n. The test cases also include assertions that are inconsistent with the function's description."

The assertion for 'multiply(14, -15)' should return 20 (unit digits are 4 and 5, and 4 * 5 = 20), which is correct. However, the assertion for 'multiply(76, 67)' should return 42 (unit digits are 6 and 7, and 6 * 7 = 42), which is also correct.

Additionally, the function does not correctly identify the closest vowel between two consonants as it only checks the character immediately after the second consonant. The test cases also reveal inconsistencies, such as 'full' returning 'u' instead of 'U', and 'Above' returning 'o' instead of 'A'. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

The checks for individual strings being balanced and the total counts of '(' and ')' are insufficient. For example, the input [')())', '(()()('] should return 'Yes' because concatenating in the order of the second string followed by the first string results in a balanced string '(()()())'. The function fails to account for the order of concatenation and the potential for balance across both strings."
exp_2_HumanEval/120,HumanEval/120,False,INCORRECT,"The function is intended to return the maximum k numbers from the array in sorted order, but it incorrectly sorts the array in descending order and then returns the first k elements without sorting them in ascending order. For example, the output for the input arr = [-3, -4, 5] and k = 3 should be sorted as [-4, -3, 5], but the function will return [5, -3, -4] instead. The test cases that expect the output to be sorted in ascending order will fail."

However, the loop starts at index 1 and increments by 2, which means it only checks elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...). Therefore, it fails to consider the elements at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...). This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases."

However, the implementation incorrectly counts the number of digits by converting the number to a string and using len(). This approach fails for negative numbers, as the '-' sign is counted as a digit, leading to incorrect results. For example, in the test case candidate([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3), the function would incorrectly sum -2, which has 2 digits, resulting in an incorrect total. The correct approach should check the absolute value of the number to determine the number of digits."

The while loop condition should include the case when the last term is 1, as the sequence should include 1. Additionally, the test assertions provided do not match the expected output for the given inputs. For example, the Collatz sequence for 14 is [14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], which contains the odd numbers [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17], but the sequence is not generated correctly in the implementation."

Specifically, the function first attempts to split the input string on whitespace, which is correct. However, if there are no words found (which is not the case for the provided examples), it then attempts to split on commas. This logic is flawed because the condition `if not words:` will never be true after the first split if there are any words present. Additionally, the handling of the case where there are no commas or whitespace is incorrect; it should return the count of lowercase letters in odd positions in the alphabet, but the implementation instead returns a list of their ASCII values. The test cases also include assertions that will fail due to these issues, such as the case for an empty string and the handling of punctuation. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

According to the function's description, if a list has more than one duplicate of the same number, it should return False. For example, the input [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] should return False, but the implementation currently returns True. Additionally, the check for duplicates is done using lst.count(lst[i]), which is inefficient and can lead to performance issues for larger lists."

The length should be calculated as 'end - start' instead of 'end - start + 1'. This is because the length of the intersection should not include both endpoints if they are equal, which is the case when the intervals touch but do not overlap. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the intersection length is exactly 1 correctly, as it should return 'NO' for lengths of 1, which is not a prime number. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/128,HumanEval/128,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prod_signs' is intended to return the sum of the magnitudes of integers multiplied by the product of their signs.

For example, in the case of 'prod_signs([0, 1])', the expected output is 0, but the function will return 0 due to the multiplication by the product of signs (which is 0). Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1]) == -10' is incorrect based on the logic of the function, as the product of signs will be -1 (due to -1 in the array) and the sum of magnitudes is 9, leading to a result of -9, not -10. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described."

The logic used to update the minPath is flawed. Specifically, the nested loops do not properly consider the neighbor cells and do not maintain the correct path structure. The function also does not correctly handle the lexicographical comparison of paths, which is crucial for determining the minimum path. As a result, the outputs for the provided test cases do not match the expected results, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."

Specifically, the recurrence relation for odd n is incorrectly implemented. The line 'result.append(tri(i - 1) + tri(i - 2) + tri(i + 1))' is problematic because it attempts to call 'tri(i + 1)', which leads to infinite recursion. Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions do not match the expected results based on the provided Tribonacci sequence definition. For example, 'tri(3)' should yield [1, 3, 2, 8], but the implementation does not produce this result due to the incorrect logic. Furthermore, the function should return integers instead of floats for the even cases, as the expected output in the assertions shows integers (e.g., 3.0 should be 3)."

The variable 'odd_digits' is initialized to 0, and the product of odd digits is calculated using multiplication. However, multiplying by 0 will always yield 0, which means the function will never return the correct product of odd digits. Instead, 'odd_digits' should be initialized to 1 to correctly calculate the product. Additionally, there is no handling for the case where there are no odd digits; the function should return 0 in that case, but it currently does not."
exp_2_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_nested' does not correctly identify nested brackets. The logic used to determine if a bracket is nested is flawed. The variable 'nested' is set to True when an opening bracket is found, but it is reset to False when a closing bracket is encountered, which does not accurately track whether there is a valid nested subsequence. For example, in the input '[[[[]]]]', the function will incorrectly return False because it resets 'nested' to False after each closing bracket, failing to recognize that there are nested brackets. The test cases that expect True for nested brackets will fail due to this logic error."
exp_2_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,INCORRECT,"The code implementation contains several issues. Firstly, the method 'map' is not a valid method for Python lists; it should be used with the built-in 'map' function or a list comprehension. Secondly, the 'toList()' method does not exist in Python.

Specifically, the condition 'last_char not in ''.join(words[:-1]).replace(' ', '')' is intended to check if the last character is not part of any preceding word, but it fails in cases where the last word is a single letter or when there are multiple spaces. For example, 'apple pi e' should return True, but the implementation incorrectly checks the last character against the entire string without properly considering the context of 'words'. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string has trailing spaces correctly, leading to incorrect results."

However, the test case 'assert candidate([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10])==2' is also incorrect because the function should return the index of the first element that is less than its predecessor, which is at index 2 (value 2). The function fails to return the correct index in this case. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([4,8,5,7,3])==4' is incorrect because the function should return 2 (the index of 5) instead of 4. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described."

exp_2_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle cases where both inputs are strings representing real numbers. Specifically, when both inputs are strings, the function converts them to floats, which can lead to incorrect comparisons if the strings represent numbers with different formats (e.g., '2,3' and '2.3'). Additionally, the function does not handle cases where one input is a string and the other is a float or integer correctly if they represent the same value. For example, '1' (as a string) and 1 (as an integer) should return None, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly in all cases."

The current implementation checks if n is equal to the sum of the first two even numbers (2 + 4 = 6), which does not fulfill the requirement of checking if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. For example, 10 can be expressed as 2 + 2 + 2 + 4, but the function would incorrectly return False for it.

For example, the test case 'Mudasir Hanif ' should return 'Mudasir_Hanif_' but it returns 'Mudasir_Hanif_' as expected. However, the test case 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow' should return 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow' but it returns 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow', which is incorrect because it does not replace the two consecutive spaces with a dash.

The condition 'if not name_parts[0].isalpha() or name_parts[0].isdigit()' does not correctly enforce that the substring must start with a letter and cannot be empty. The method 'isalpha()' will return True for strings that contain only letters, but it does not check if the string is empty. Additionally, the check for the extension does not account for the case where the substring before the dot is valid but the extension is not. Therefore, the function does not correctly validate all the specified conditions for a valid file name."

Specifically, the function squares the integer at an index that is a multiple of 3, which is correct, but it also squares the integer at an index that is a multiple of 4, instead of cubing it as required. This leads to incorrect results for test cases where the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3. For example, for the input [-56,-99,1,0,-2], the expected output is 3030, but the function will not produce this result due to the incorrect handling of the cubing condition."

For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, so it should not be included in the output. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' is expected to return an empty string, which is correct. The issue arises with the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""', where 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime, but 'available' (9) is not. Therefore, the expected output should be 'there is no', not 'there is no place'. The implementation fails to account for the correct identification of prime lengths."

The current logic checks if the product of the evaluated float values is equal to its integer conversion, which can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in a whole number. This can be achieved by checking if (x_numerator * n_numerator) % (x_denominator * n_denominator) == 0. As a result, some test cases will fail, such as 'simplify(""1/6"", ""2/1"")' which should return False but may not due to the floating-point comparison."

Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly when calculating the sum of digits, as it treats the negative sign as a digit. The expected behavior is to sort by the sum of the absolute values of the digits, and if two numbers have the same sum, they should maintain their original order.

For example, calling intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4) should yield [1, 4, 2, 4, 3], but the current implementation would yield [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4], which is incorrect. The test case check(candidate([2, 2, 2], 2) == [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] also fails because it would produce [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]."
exp_3_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. Instead of tracking the maximum depth, it simply counts the number of open and close parentheses, which does not reflect the nesting levels. Additionally, the use of 'count++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'count += 1'. The function should maintain a variable to track the maximum depth encountered during the iteration over the characters in each group."
exp_3_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function filter_by_substring is correct in terms of filtering strings that contain the specified substring. However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is incorrect because 'grunt' does not contain the substring 'run'. The correct output for this input should be an empty list, as none of the strings contain the substring 'run'. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the implementation is incorrect due to the faulty test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' does not handle the case of an empty list correctly. While it initializes 'sum_' to 0 and 'product' to 1, the loop that calculates the product does not execute for an empty list, leading 'product' to remain 1 as intended. However, the product calculation for non-empty lists is incorrect because it multiplies by 'number' without checking if 'number' is zero. For example, in the case of the input [100, 0], the expected product should be 0, but the function will return 0 due to the multiplication logic. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for cases where the input list contains a zero."
exp_3_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list of integers. It initializes an empty list 'max_elements' and iterates through the input list 'numbers'. For each element, it appends the maximum of the current element and the last recorded maximum to 'max_elements'. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various scenarios, including an empty list and lists with increasing, decreasing, and mixed values. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_3_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is incorrectly implemented. The logic for finding the longest palindromic postfix is flawed. The variable 'longest_postfix' is initialized to the reverse of the entire string, which is incorrect. The loop should check for the longest palindromic prefix instead of the postfix. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are incorrectly checking 'is_palindrome' instead of 'make_palindrome'. The assertions should be directed towards 'make_palindrome' to validate its correctness."
exp_3_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. The XOR operation should be performed on all bits, and if one string is shorter, it should be padded with zeros on the left. For example, '111000' and '101010' should yield '010010', but the current implementation will only XOR the first three bits, resulting in '010' instead of the expected output."
exp_3_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the current implementation will return the last longest string encountered in the loop, which violates this requirement. For example, if the input is ['abc', 'def', 'gh'], the function will return 'gh' instead of 'abc'. The test cases provided in the 'check' function also confirm this issue, as the assertion for candidate(['x', 'y', 'z']) expects 'x' but the implementation will return 'z'."

The provided test cases in the check function cover various scenarios, including coprime numbers (3, 7), a case with a common divisor (10, 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49, 14), and a case with larger numbers (144, 60). All assertions in the check function pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."

exp_3_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers. The use of ''.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) results in a concatenated string without any delimiters. To fix this, the correct implementation should use ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) to ensure that the numbers are space-delimited as required by the function's description."
exp_3_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function count_distinct_characters is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the distinct character count should be case insensitive. The test case count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ') should return 3, which is correct, but the test case count_distinct_characters('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') should return 5, which is also correct. However, the implementation is unnecessarily checking if the character is not in the set before adding it, as adding to a set inherently ensures uniqueness. The function should simply convert the string to lowercase and return the length of the set created from the characters, which would simplify the code and maintain correctness."
exp_3_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the musical notes according to the specified legend. The function treats each character individually, but the notes 'o|', 'o', and '.|' are multi-character strings that need to be recognized as single units. As a result, the function fails to return the correct list of beats for inputs that include these multi-character notes. For example, the input 'o| o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o' should yield [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4], but the current implementation will not produce this output."

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_3_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_numbers' is incorrect because the sorting key used in the lambda function, 'int(x[1:])', does not correctly convert the string representations of numbers ('zero' to 'nine') into their corresponding integer values. Instead, it attempts to convert the substring starting from the second character of each word, which leads to incorrect sorting. For example, 'three' would be treated as 'ree' which cannot be converted to an integer. The correct approach would involve mapping the string representations to their integer values using a predefined dictionary or list."
exp_3_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly find the closest elements in all cases. The nested loops only consider pairs where the first number is less than the second, which can lead to missing pairs that are closer together. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', the closest elements are 5.0 and 5.9, but the function will not find them because it only checks pairs in increasing order. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest elements are equal correctly, as it only returns pairs where the first element is less than the second."
exp_3_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the maximum and minimum values are the same. In such a case, the denominator in the expression '(max_num - min_num)' becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. The test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is also incorrect because the expected output is not properly rescaled; it should return [1.0, 0.0] but the function will not produce this due to the incorrect handling of the scaling logic."
exp_3_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose as described in the docstring.

exp_3_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is intended to return the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. However, the implementation incorrectly returns n when the divisor is less than or equal to 1, which is not the expected behavior. For example, for n = 3, the function should return 1, but it will return 3 instead. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n is less than or equal to 1 correctly, as it should return 0 or indicate that there are no divisors. The test cases in the check function expect the correct behavior, but the implementation fails to meet these expectations."
exp_3_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error in the line 'i++', which is not valid in Python. The correct increment operation should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be 'n //= i' to ensure that n remains an integer during factorization. These issues will prevent the function from executing correctly and producing the expected results."

But in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output should be [1, 4, 5], which is incorrect because it retains the first occurrence of 2 and 3 instead of removing all duplicates. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirement."
exp_3_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly implements the logic to swap the case of each alphabetical character in the input string while leaving non-alphabetical characters unchanged.

exp_3_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is expected to return a list of strings that start with the given prefix. However, the test assertion check(candidate) fails because the expected output for the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] with prefix 'xxx' is incorrectly stated. The correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list. The implementation itself is correct, but the test assertions do not match the expected behavior."

However, the first test assertion with input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6] is expected to return [4, 5, 6], which is also correct. The function implementation is correct, but the test assertions do not cover all edge cases properly. The function should also handle zero correctly, which it does by excluding it. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the evaluation of the test cases is misleading."
exp_3_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is missing an import statement for the math module, which is necessary for using math.sqrt.

exp_3_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function assumes that the polynomial can be solved using the formula -xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1]), which is only valid for specific types of quadratic polynomials (i.e., polynomials of degree 2). However, the function is supposed to handle polynomials of any degree with an even number of coefficients. The provided test cases and the description imply that the function should find a root for any polynomial defined by the coefficients in 'xs', not just quadratics. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the task."

The sorted list 'l_sorted' is created but the values assigned to indices divisible by three are taken from 'l_sorted' using the index 'i // 3', which does not correspond to the correct sorted values for those specific indices. This leads to incorrect results as seen in the test assertions. For example, in the case of the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the function does not produce this output."

This leads to a failure in validating the correctness of the decoding process."
exp_3_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number found in the list of primes instead of collecting all Fibonacci primes. For example, when n = 1, it correctly returns 2, but when n = 2, it returns 3, which is correct, but the logic fails for higher values of n. The function does not iterate through all Fibonacci numbers and check for primality correctly. The test cases include Fibonacci primes beyond the pre-defined list, which the function does not account for, leading to incorrect results for n > 5. The function should generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality dynamically instead of relying on a fixed list."

The use of the 'seen' set is flawed because it adds elements as they are encountered, which means that it can skip valid combinations of 'a', 'b', and 'c' that could sum to zero. For example, if the list contains duplicate values, the function may incorrectly ignore them when they should be considered distinct. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs, such as [1, 3, -2, 1] where the distinct elements 1, -2, and 1 should be considered, but the implementation fails to do so."

Firstly, the use of 'collisions++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Secondly, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The function does not correctly account for the fact that each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left. For n cars in each direction, the total number of collisions should simply be n * n, which means the expected output for the test cases should be n^2, not the values currently being returned.

The function does not produce these results based on the provided recurrence relation. The expected values for fib4(5), fib4(6), and fib4(7) are also not validated against the recurrence relation, leading to a mismatch with the expected outputs.

However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which is correct for calculating 2^n modulo p. The provided test cases, including the additional assertions in the check function, reveal that the function fails for certain inputs. Specifically, the assertions 'assert candidate(30, 5) == 4' and 'assert candidate(31, 5) == 3' are incorrect because 2^30 modulo 5 equals 4 and 2^31 modulo 5 equals 3, which are correct results. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases are misleading. The evaluation of the function is correct based on the mathematical definition, but the test cases should be re-evaluated for correctness."

The derivative of a polynomial term ax^n is n*ax^(n-1). Therefore, the correct implementation should multiply each coefficient by its respective power index. For example, for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the correct derivative should be calculated as follows: 1*1 (for x^1), 2*2 (for x^2), 3*4 (for x^3), and 4*5 (for x^4), resulting in [1, 4, 12, 20]. The current implementation fails to perform these multiplications, leading to incorrect results."
exp_3_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function is incorrect because it does not return the expected values for certain inputs. Specifically, the function returns n for inputs less than 3, which is not consistent with the defined sequence. According to the definition, fibfib(0) should return 0, fibfib(1) should return 0, and fibfib(2) should return 1, which is correct. However, for n >= 3, the function should compute the sum of the three preceding values, which it does correctly. The test assertions include checks for fibfib(10) and fibfib(12) that are not validated by the current implementation, leading to potential discrepancies in expected results. The implementation fails to provide the correct output for all cases, particularly for n < 3."
exp_3_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error: 'count++' is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment 'count' is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly, as it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases provided do not cover all scenarios, such as words with mixed case or words ending with 'y' that should be counted as a vowel. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."
exp_3_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the circular_shift function does not correctly handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits. According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the function should return the digits reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits if the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits. This leads to incorrect results for cases like circular_shift(100, 2), which should return '001' but instead returns '100'. Additionally, the test cases do not cover all edge cases, and the assertion for candidate(100, 2) fails, indicating the implementation is not correct."
exp_3_HumanEval/66,HumanEval/66,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'digitSum' correctly calculates the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the input string. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and mixed-case strings, and the function passes all assertions. The logic of iterating through each character, checking if it is uppercase, and summing their ASCII values using 'ord' is sound and aligns with the task description."
exp_3_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'fruit_distribution' contains errors in how it extracts the number of apples and oranges from the input string. Specifically, the method used to split and strip the string does not correctly parse the quantities of apples and oranges. The line 'total_fruits = s.split("" "")[0].strip(""apples"")' will not yield the correct number of apples because it only retrieves the first word of the string, which is the number of apples, but does not account for the presence of 'and' or the second fruit type. Additionally, the line 'total_oranges = s.split("" "")[1].strip(""oranges"")' incorrectly assumes that the second word will always be the number of oranges, which is not the case. This leads to incorrect calculations and results in failing assertions in the test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even values are the same and the smallest. Specifically, the logic for updating 'smallest_index' when encountering an even number that is equal to 'smallest_even' is flawed. It should not update 'smallest_index' in this case, as it should retain the index of the first occurrence of the smallest even value. This leads to incorrect results for inputs like [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2], where the expected output is [0, 1], but the function may return an incorrect index due to the flawed logic."
exp_3_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'search' function does not correctly handle the requirement that the frequency of an integer must be greater than or equal to the integer itself. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because the integer 1 appears once, which is equal to its value. However, the function returns 5, which is incorrect as its frequency (4) is greater than its value (5). Additionally, the function does not account for the case where multiple integers meet the criteria; it only returns the greatest integer found, which may not be valid based on the frequency condition. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."
exp_3_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly handle the case where there are duplicate minimum or maximum values in the list. Specifically, when the minimum or maximum value is removed, if there are duplicates, only one instance is removed, which can lead to incorrect ordering in the final result. For example, in the case of the input [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not produce this output as it removes only one instance of -5 and 5 each time it is encountered. Thus, the function fails to achieve the desired 'strange order' sorting."
exp_3_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not represent the correct calculation for the area of a triangle given its three sides. The correct method to calculate the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is to use Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the rounding method used (area.round(2)) is incorrect; it should be round(area, 2). Therefore, the function will not return the expected results for valid triangles."
exp_3_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the list is empty. According to the problem description, an empty list should return False because it is not balanced (not a palindromic list). The current implementation returns True for an empty list, which violates the requirement. Additionally, the function checks for balance (palindromic) only after checking the sum, which is not the correct order of operations according to the description."
exp_3_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The function currently returns the index of the last element that does not match its counterpart, which does not represent the number of changes required. For example, in the case of the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6], the function incorrectly returns 4 instead of the correct value of 4 changes needed. The logic should count the number of mismatches between the elements from the start and the end of the array, and return that count instead."
exp_3_HumanEval/74,HumanEval/74,True,INCORRECT,"The function total_match does not correctly handle the case where the total number of characters in both lists is equal. According to the specification, it should return the first list, but the implementation does not account for the case where the second list has the same total number of characters as the first list. The test case total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) is expected to return ['hi', 'admin'], but it will not pass because the total character count is equal (8 characters each). Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_3_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime does not correctly implement the logic to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The current implementation only checks if the number is prime itself, which is not the requirement. For example, is_multiply_prime(30) should return True, but the function will return False for numbers like 8 and 10, which are not products of three primes. Additionally, the function does not account for the requirement of exactly three prime factors, as it only checks for primality. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the specified criteria."
exp_3_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will lead to a NameError in Python. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is not sufficient to ensure that x is a simple power of n; it should also check if 'x' is equal to 'n' raised to the power of 'int(math.log(x, n))' without the 'int' check. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion that expects 'candidate(9, 3) == True', which is incorrect since 9 is indeed 3 squared. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if x is a simple power of n."
exp_3_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it uses the expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' to determine if 'a' is a perfect cube. This method can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for larger integers. For example, while it may correctly identify small cubes like 1, -1, and 64, it may fail for larger numbers like 1000 or 1728 due to rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic. A more reliable approach would be to compute the cube root using integer arithmetic and check if cubing that integer returns the original number."
exp_3_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'hex_key' contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment 'count' in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the condition in the if statement is not correctly structured; it should use parentheses to group the conditions properly. The current implementation will not run successfully, leading to incorrect results. Furthermore, the function does not account for the hexadecimal digits 'B' and 'D' correctly due to the flawed condition."
exp_3_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'decimal_to_binary' is incorrect because it does not correctly format the binary representation of the decimal number. Specifically, it pads the binary string with leading zeros to make it 8 bits long, which is not required by the problem statement. The expected output for decimal_to_binary(15) should be 'db1111db', but the current implementation would return 'db00001111db'. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior."
exp_3_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct. The loop and condition used in the function do not properly evaluate all groups of 3 consecutive letters in the string. Instead, it incorrectly compares non-overlapping groups of 3 letters. For example, in the string 'iopaxioi', the function would incorrectly return True, while it should return False because the substring 'ioi' contains repeating letters. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements for determining if a string is happy."
exp_3_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'numerical_letter_grade' does not correctly handle the GPA values that are exactly equal to the thresholds defined in the grading table. For example, the GPA of 3.0 should yield 'B+', but the current implementation will return 'B+' for values greater than or equal to 3.0, which is correct. However, the GPA of 1.0 should yield 'D+', but the implementation will return 'D+' for values greater than or equal to 1.0, which is also correct. The issue arises with the GPA of 0.0, which should yield 'E' but is handled correctly. The test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, particularly around the threshold values, leading to potential inaccuracies in grading. The implementation should be revised to ensure that it strictly adheres to the specified grading boundaries."
exp_3_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' does not correctly determine if the length of the string is a prime number. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the string length is 2, which is a prime number. The loop that checks for factors starts from 2 and goes up to the string length, but it should check only up to the square root of the string length for efficiency and correctness. Additionally, the function should return True for strings of length 2, which it currently does not. Therefore, the assertions that expect True for strings of length 2 will fail."
exp_3_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'starts_one_ends' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for counting n-digit integers that start or end with 1 is incorrect. The range should be from 10**(n-1) to 10**n to ensure that only n-digit numbers are considered. The current implementation counts all numbers from 0 to 10**n - 1, which includes numbers with fewer than n digits."
exp_3_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is supposed to return the sum of the digits of the binary representation of the integer N, but it instead returns the sum as an integer, not as a binary string. The expected outputs in the test assertions are binary strings, but the implementation does not convert the sum back to binary format before returning it. For example, for N = 1000, the sum of the binary digits is 1, which is correct, but it should return '1' as a string. The same issue occurs for other test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are located at odd indices in the list. However, the current implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 88])', the function returns 88, which is correct, but in 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', it returns 122, which is incorrect because 5 (at index 1) is odd and should not be included in the sum. The function does not filter for even numbers, leading to incorrect results for several test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not preserve the spaces between words in the output. The implementation joins the ordered words without adding spaces back, which leads to a concatenated string without spaces. For example, 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation will return 'Hello!!!Wdlor', which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle punctuation properly, as it does not separate punctuation from words when sorting."
exp_3_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the requirements. The sorting logic combines two separate sorts into one return statement, which results in incorrect ordering. Specifically, it first sorts by row in ascending order and then appends a separate sort by column in descending order, which does not maintain the intended structure of having all coordinates of the same row together. The correct approach would be to sort the coordinates first by row and then, for each row, sort the columns in descending order."
exp_3_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of summing the values at the first and last indices of the array, it sums the indices themselves (0 and len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior for arrays with more than one element. For example, for the array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last values (2 + 6) is 8 (even), but the function will incorrectly sort it in descending order because it checks the sum of indices (0 + 6 = 6, which is even). Thus, the sorting logic does not work as intended based on the problem description."
exp_3_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,True,INCORRECT,"The function encrypt is intended to rotate the alphabet by 4 positions (2 multiplied by 2). However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the new character position. The formula used in the code does not account for the correct rotation when characters are near the end of the alphabet. For example, 'y' should become 'c', but it incorrectly wraps around to 'a'. Additionally, the test cases provided do not match the expected outputs based on the described functionality. For instance, 'faewfawefaewg' should yield 'jeiajeaijeiak' according to the test case, but the actual output does not match this expectation. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly identify the second smallest element in all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the smallest element appears multiple times. For example, in the case of next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected output is None since there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the logic for updating the second_smallest variable is flawed, as it does not properly account for the scenario where the smallest value is repeated."
exp_3_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The code implementation has a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should use 'boredoms += 1'.

Firstly, the return values 'true' and 'false' should be 'True' and 'False' (with capital T and F) in Python. Secondly, the condition to check if all numbers are integers is incorrectly placed; it should be checked before performing any arithmetic operations. The current implementation will raise an AttributeError because 'float' objects do not have an 'is_integer()' method. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the inputs are not integers properly, as it does not return False if any of the inputs are not integers. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. The logic for replacing vowels is flawed, as it incorrectly calculates the index and does not properly handle the replacement within the same loop. Additionally, the function appends an extra character after each vowel, which is not intended. For example, in the test case 'This is a message', the expected output is 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG', but the implementation does not produce this result."
exp_3_HumanEval/94,HumanEval/94,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'skjkasdkd' contains an error in the way it calculates the sum of the digits of the largest prime number. Specifically, it uses the division operator '/' instead of the integer division operator '//' when reducing 'largest_prime' in the while loop. This will cause 'largest_prime' to become a float, which will lead to incorrect results when calculating the sum of its digits. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no prime numbers in the list correctly, as it returns 0 instead of an appropriate value. The test cases provided may pass, but the implementation is fundamentally flawed."

However, the implementation does not correctly handle the requirement of returning the first n primes. Instead, it returns all prime numbers less than n, which does not align with the function's description. For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5] (the first 3 primes), but the implementation would return [2, 3, 5]. The test cases also include assertions that expect the function to return a specific number of primes, which the current implementation does not satisfy."

Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results for all test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the rounding away from zero for equidistant values. Specifically, when the input is '-15.5', the expected output is -16, but the function will not return this correctly due to the way it calculates candidates. The candidates list only includes integers that are directly adjacent to the value, which does not account for the correct rounding behavior specified in the function's description. The logic for determining the closest integer should explicitly check for equidistant cases and round accordingly."
exp_3_HumanEval/100,HumanEval/100,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'make_a_pile' does not correctly generate the number of stones for each level based on whether 'n' is odd or even. Specifically, the logic used to append stones to the list is flawed. For even 'n', it incorrectly starts from 3 and adds even numbers, while for odd 'n', it starts from 2 and adds odd numbers. The correct approach should be to start from 'n' and add the next odd/even number based on the parity of 'n'. Therefore, the expected output does not match the actual output for the provided test cases."

Firstly, the method 'Integer.toBinaryString' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with 'bin()' to convert an integer to its binary representation. Secondly, the rounding of the average is incorrectly handled; the method 'avg.roundToInt()' does not exist in Python. Instead, the average should be rounded using the built-in 'round()' function. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include assertions that will fail due to the incorrect implementation of the rounding and binary conversion.

exp_3_HumanEval/104,HumanEval/104,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'unique_digits' is incorrect because it attempts to check if all digits of a number are odd by iterating over the string representation of the number and applying the modulo operation. However, it incorrectly applies the modulo operation to the string characters instead of their integer values. The expression 'all(d % 2 != 0 for d in str(num))' will raise a TypeError since 'd' is a string character and cannot be used with the modulo operator directly.

This leads to incorrect results when the input contains numbers outside the specified range. For example, the input [1, -1, 55] should return ['One'], but the current implementation would return an empty list because it sorts and reverses the entire array before filtering. The filtering should occur before sorting and reversing to ensure only valid numbers are processed."

Additionally, the implementation is inefficient with a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the use of slicing and summing sub-arrays.

exp_3_HumanEval/116,HumanEval/116,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' contains several issues. Firstly, the use of 'arr.map' and 'arr.sort_by' suggests a Ruby syntax rather than Python, which would lead to a syntax error in Python. In Python, the equivalent would be 'map' and 'sorted' functions. Secondly, the expected output in the test assertions does not match the expected behavior described in the function's docstring. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' should be '[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]' based on the number of ones in binary representation, but the provided implementation does not sort correctly according to the specified criteria. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

exp_3_HumanEval/118,HumanEval/118,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function get_closest_vowel has several issues. Firstly, the loop iterates from the end of the word to the beginning, but the conditions to find consonants and vowels are not correctly checking for the closest vowel between two consonants. Specifically, the condition 'if word[i] in consonants and word[i + 1] in consonants' will not return the closest vowel; instead, it will return an empty string if two consonants are found. Additionally, the function converts the entire word to uppercase, which causes it to lose the case sensitivity required by the problem statement. The test cases also indicate that the function does not return the expected results for several inputs, such as 'full' and 'Above'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/119,HumanEval/119,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation does not correctly determine if the concatenation of the two strings can form a balanced parentheses string. The checks for individual strings being balanced are unnecessary, as the function should only check if the total number of opening and closing parentheses across both strings are equal. Additionally, the function fails to account for the order of concatenation, which is crucial for determining if a valid sequence can be formed. For example, the input ['(()(())', '())())'] should return 'No' because even though both strings have balanced parentheses individually, their concatenation does not yield a balanced string. The function should instead check if the total number of opening parentheses is greater than or equal to the total number of closing parentheses at every point in the concatenation process."
exp_3_HumanEval/120,HumanEval/120,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'maximum' is supposed to return the k largest numbers from the input array 'arr' in sorted order. However, the implementation sorts the array in descending order and then returns the first k elements without sorting them in ascending order. This results in the output not matching the expected output for the test cases. For example, for the input arr = [-3, -4, 5] and k = 3, the expected output is [-4, -3, 5], but the function will return [5, -3, -4], which is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/121,HumanEval/121,False,INCORRECT,"The function is supposed to return the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions (0-based index). However, the loop starts from index 1 and increments by 2, which means it only checks elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...). Therefore, it fails to evaluate the elements at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...). For example, in the input [5, 8, 7, 1], the odd element at index 0 (5) is not included in the sum, leading to an incorrect result."
exp_3_HumanEval/122,HumanEval/122,True,INCORRECT,"The function add_elements is intended to sum elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of the array.

Therefore, the implementation does not produce the expected results for all test cases."

Specifically, the sequence is not being terminated correctly, and the odd numbers are not being collected accurately. For example, the assertion candidate(14) == [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] fails because the actual odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for 14 are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13] but the function does not include all odd numbers correctly. The function should also ensure that the sequence is generated until it reaches 1, and the odd numbers should be collected from the entire sequence generated."

It allows for 29 days in February without checking for leap years, which means it could incorrectly validate dates like '02-29-2021' (not a leap year) as valid. Additionally, the checks for the number of days for months with 31 days are redundant since they are already covered by the general check for days being between 1 and 31. The function also does not handle the case where the day is 0 or negative, which should return False. Therefore, the implementation does not fully satisfy the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_3_HumanEval/125,HumanEval/125,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'split_words' does not correctly handle the specified requirements. The first issue is that the function attempts to split the input string on whitespace and commas, but it does not correctly check for the absence of whitespace or commas before proceeding to count lowercase letters. Additionally, the counting of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet is not implemented correctly; the function returns a list of ASCII values instead of the count of those letters. Furthermore, the test cases do not match the expected outputs for some inputs, particularly for cases where the input string contains both whitespace and commas. The function should return a count (an integer) when there are no valid splits, but it currently returns a list instead."
exp_3_HumanEval/126,HumanEval/126,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_sorted incorrectly returns True for lists that contain duplicates more than once. According to the function's description, if a list has more than 1 duplicate of the same number, it should return False. The implementation checks for duplicates but does not account for the requirement of only allowing one duplicate. For example, the input [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] should return False, but the function returns True. This violates the specified behavior."
exp_3_HumanEval/127,HumanEval/127,False,INCORRECT,"The function incorrectly calculates the length of the intersection. The length should be calculated as 'end - start' instead of 'end - start + 1'. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the intersection is a single point, which should not be considered a prime number. For example, in the case of intersection((1, 2), (1, 2)), the length would be calculated as 0 (incorrectly) instead of 1, leading to an incorrect return value of 'NO'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the intersection is exactly one unit long correctly, as it should return 'NO' for lengths of 1, which is not prime."
exp_3_HumanEval/128,HumanEval/128,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prod_signs' does not correctly compute the product of the signs of the integers in the array. The expected behavior is to multiply the sum of magnitudes by the product of the signs. However, the current implementation simply uses the sign of each number to multiply its magnitude, which does not yield the correct result. For example, in the case of 'prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])', the expected output is -9, but the function calculates it incorrectly. The product of signs for this input should be -1 (since there is one negative number), and the sum of magnitudes is 9, leading to the correct result of -9. However, the implementation does not handle the signs correctly, leading to incorrect results for other test cases as well."

The logic for determining the next steps and updating the visited cells is flawed. Specifically, the way the next steps are determined does not ensure that the path is built correctly according to the problem's requirements. Additionally, the output does not match the expected results for the provided test cases, indicating that the algorithm does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest path of length k."

The base cases for tri(0), tri(1), and tri(2) are incorrect. Specifically, tri(0) should return an empty list, tri(1) should return [3], and tri(2) should return [3, 2]. Additionally, the recursive case for odd n is incorrectly implemented, as it uses tri(n + 1) instead of tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n - 1). The test assertions also expect floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 3.0), which is inconsistent with the expected integer outputs of the Tribonacci sequence. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_3_HumanEval/131,HumanEval/131,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'digits' is incorrect because it initializes 'odd_digits' to 0 and uses multiplication to accumulate the product of odd digits. As a result, any multiplication with 0 will always yield 0, which means the function will never return the correct product of odd digits. Instead, 'odd_digits' should be initialized to 1 (the multiplicative identity) and should be multiplied by 'digit' only when 'digit' is odd. Additionally, if no odd digits are found, the function should return 0, which is not handled correctly in the current implementation."
exp_3_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_nested' does not correctly identify nested brackets. The logic used to determine if brackets are nested is flawed. Specifically, the condition that checks if a bracket is nested relies on the 'nested' variable being set to True, but it does not properly account for the structure of the brackets. For example, in the case of the input '[[]]', the function will return True as expected, but for other cases like '[][]' or '[]', it will incorrectly return True due to the way the 'nested' variable is manipulated. The function fails to correctly identify valid nested subsequences in various test cases, which leads to incorrect results."
exp_3_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' contains several issues. Firstly, the method 'map' is not a valid method for Python lists; it should be replaced with a list comprehension or the built-in 'map' function. Secondly, the 'toList()' method does not exist in Python; it should be removed. Additionally, the rounding and squaring logic is not correctly implemented due to the incorrect usage of 'map'. Lastly, the expected outputs in the comments do not match the correct calculations based on the provided examples. For instance, the expected output for lst = [1.4, 4.2, 0] should be 29, but the actual calculation results in 29 when rounded correctly. Therefore, the code does not fulfill the requirements as described."

Specifically, the test case 'assert candidate([1,2,4,5])==-1' is incorrect because the function should return -1 when all elements are in increasing order, which it does correctly. However, the test case 'assert candidate([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10])==2' is incorrect because the function should return 1 (the index of 4) instead of 2, as 4 is not greater than 1. Thus, the implementation fails to meet the requirements as described in the function's docstring."

Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_3_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where one of the inputs is a string representing a number with a comma (e.g., '2,3'). The function replaces commas with periods but does not convert the string to a float before comparing. This can lead to incorrect comparisons, especially when one input is a float and the other is a string. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where both inputs are strings with commas correctly, as it only attempts to convert them to floats if both are strings. The test cases also indicate that the function should return the larger value in its original type, but the implementation does not ensure this when converting to float. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_3_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_equal_to_sum_even is incorrectly implemented. It only checks if n is equal to the sum of the first four positive even numbers (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20). However, the task requires checking if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The correct implementation should consider all combinations of four positive even numbers that sum to n, not just check against a fixed value. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct results for inputs like 10, 12, and 16, which can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers."
exp_3_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' does not correctly compute the Brazilian factorial as defined in the comments. The current implementation only calculates the regular factorial of 'n' (n!), but it should compute the product of all factorials from n down to 1, i.e., n! * (n-1)! * ... * 1!. This is why the test cases fail, as the expected outputs do not match the results produced by the current implementation."
exp_3_HumanEval/140,HumanEval/140,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'fix_spaces' does not correctly handle the replacement of spaces as described in the comments. Specifically, the regex substitution replaces all consecutive spaces with '-' if there are more than 2 spaces, but it does not replace single or double spaces with '_' as required. For example, the test case 'Mudasir Hanif ' should return 'Mudasir_Hanif_' but instead returns 'Mudasir_Hanif_' which is correct. However, the test case 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow' should return 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow' but it returns 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow', which is also correct. The main issue is that the function does not handle the replacement of single and double spaces correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain cases."

Specifically, the check for the starting character of the file name is incorrect. The line 'if not file_name.startswith(string.ascii_letters) or file_name.startswith(string.digits):' is not valid because 'startswith' checks if the string starts with any of the characters in the provided string, not if it starts with a letter. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the substring before the dot is empty, as it only checks for the presence of a dot and not the content before it. The logic for counting digits is also flawed, as it does not properly account for the case where there are more than three digits after the initial check. Overall, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."
exp_3_HumanEval/142,HumanEval/142,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly implement the logic described in the comments.

The current implementation squares the integer at index 0 (which is a multiple of 3) but does not account for the requirement that integers at indices that are multiples of 4 (but not multiples of 3) should be cubed. For example, in the list [-56,-99,1,0,-2], the integer at index 4 (-2) should be cubed, but the current implementation does not do this. Therefore, the output for this test case is incorrect, leading to an overall incorrect implementation."

For example, the input 'here' should return an empty string, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly. Additionally, the function lacks the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for determining if the length of a word is prime. Without this, the code will raise an error when executed."
exp_3_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly determine if the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The current logic checks if the product of the decimal values of the fractions is equal to its integer representation, which can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in a whole number by checking if the numerator modulo the denominator equals zero. This would ensure that the result is a whole number without relying on floating-point arithmetic."
exp_3_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the requirement to sort numbers based on the sum of their digits while maintaining the original order for items with the same digit sum. The current implementation only sorts by the sum of digits, which can lead to incorrect ordering when multiple numbers have the same digit sum. For example, in the test case 'order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])', the expected output is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11], but the implementation will not maintain the original order for numbers with the same digit sum.

Additionally, the logic for checking the first digit is incorrect; it only checks if the second-to-last digit is 1 or 9 instead of checking the first digit of the number. The correct approach would involve converting the number to a string and checking the first and last characters. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail the assertions."

Secondly, the sorting logic is incorrect; the function attempts to sort the list twice, which will not yield the desired result. The first sort by length will be overridden by the second sort, which sorts alphabetically. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to sort by length and filter based on even lengths.

The expected output should be the absolute difference between the actual scores and the guesses, which is correctly calculated in the implementation. However, the test case itself is flawed as it does not align with the problem statement's requirement of comparing scores and guesses.

However, the current implementation incorrectly returns 'number + remaining' for the total eaten carrots but does not account for the need correctly. For example, in the case of eat(5, 6, 10), the expected output is [11, 4], but the function would return [11, 10] instead, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the total needed is less than or equal to the remaining correctly, as it should return the remaining carrots after eating the needed amount."

However, the implementation evaluates it as (2 ** 3) * 4 + 5 = 32 + 5 = 37, which is correct in this case, but it will fail for other combinations where operator precedence matters.

For example, '1234' should return '4321', which is correctly handled, but if the input were an empty string '', it would return '' instead of the expected behavior of reversing it.

The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' for negative values. This leads to incorrect balance calculations and causes the function to return incorrect results for certain test cases."

However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD values. For example, the MAD for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), but the assertion checks for a value of 2/3 which is correct. The assertion for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] is also correct as it checks for 1.0. However, the assertion for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] checks for 6.0/5.0 which is incorrect. The correct MAD for this list should be 2.0. Therefore, while the function itself is correct, the test cases are flawed, leading to an overall evaluation of INCORRECT."

Specifically, the logic in the for loop is flawed. The condition `if i % 2 != 0 or i != len(numbers) - 1` causes the delimiter to be added incorrectly, resulting in extra delimiters being added at the end of the list. For example, calling `intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)` should yield `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`, but the current implementation would produce `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4]`, which is incorrect.

The assertion 'assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'aaaxxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xx') == ['xxx', 'aaaxxy', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']' is also incorrect as 'aaaxxy' does not contain 'xx'.

Specifically, when the list contains a zero (e.g., [100, 0]), the product should be 0, but the current implementation will return 0 due to the initialization of 'product' to 1 and multiplying it by 0. The correct behavior should account for the case where the list contains a zero, resulting in a product of 0. Therefore, the function fails the test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)'."

For example, if 'a' is '111000' and 'b' is '101010', the expected output should consider the remaining bits of 'a' after the shorter string 'b' is exhausted. The correct implementation should either pad the shorter string or handle the differing lengths appropriately."

The function treats each character individually, but the notes 'o|', 'o', and '.|' are multi-character strings that should be parsed as single units. As a result, the function fails to return the correct list of beats for inputs that include these multi-character notes. For example, the input 'o|' should yield 2 beats, but the current implementation would incorrectly interpret 'o' and '|' separately, resulting in incorrect output."

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the polynomial degree is greater than 2, nor does it account for the possibility of multiple roots or complex roots. Therefore, the implementation is not robust and does not correctly find the zero of the polynomial for all valid inputs."

For example, when n=1, it correctly returns 2, but for n=2, it returns 3, which is correct, but for n=6, it should return 233, which is correct, but the logic is flawed as it does not iterate through all Fibonacci numbers to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number. The function should generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number, rather than relying on a predefined list of Fibonacci and prime numbers."

The purpose of the 'seen' set is to track distinct elements, but the current implementation incorrectly adds elements to 'seen' during the nested loops, which prevents the function from correctly identifying distinct triplets. As a result, it may return True for cases where there are not three distinct elements that sum to zero. For example, in the case of the input [1, 3, -2, 1], the function may incorrectly consider the duplicate '1' as a distinct element.

These issues will lead to syntax errors when the function is executed, causing it to fail before any logic can be evaluated."
exp_4_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial excluding the constant term (the first coefficient), but it does not correctly compute the derivative of the polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial term ax^n is n*ax^(n-1). Therefore, the correct derivative for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] should be [1*1, 2*2, 3*4, 4*5] which results in [1, 4, 12, 20]. The implementation fails to multiply the coefficients by their respective powers, leading to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function is incorrect because the base cases for fibfib(0) and fibfib(1) should return 0, but the current implementation returns the input value 'n' for any n less than 3. This leads to incorrect results for inputs like fibfib(0) and fibfib(1). Additionally, the test assertions include checks for fibfib(10), fibfib(12), and fibfib(14), which are not validated by the current implementation, as the results for these inputs are not defined in the comments or the provided examples."
exp_4_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error: 'count++' is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment the count variable is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly, as the string 'vowels' is defined in lowercase. To fix this, the function should either convert the input string to lowercase or include uppercase vowels in the 'vowels' string. Furthermore, the test cases do not cover all possible scenarios, such as words ending with 'y' or mixed case inputs. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect and requires fixes."
exp_4_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'circular_shift' function does not correctly handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits. According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the function should return the digits reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits if the shift is greater than or equal to the length of the digits, which is incorrect. For example, for the input (100, 2), the expected output is '001', but the function will return '010' instead. This discrepancy leads to the failure of the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""'."
exp_4_HumanEval/66,HumanEval/66,True,CORRECT,"The function 'digitSum' correctly computes the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the input string. The implementation iterates through each character in the string, checks if it is uppercase using 'isupper()', and if so, adds its ASCII value (obtained using 'ord()') to the cumulative sum. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and mixed-case strings, and the function returns the expected results for all assertions. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_4_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, the logic for updating 'smallest_index' is flawed. The current implementation only updates 'smallest_index' when a smaller even number is found, but it does not correctly handle the case where the same smallest even number appears again at a smaller index. As a result, it fails to return the correct index for the smallest even number when duplicates exist. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4 ,8]) == [4, 1]', the expected output is [4, 1] because the first occurrence of 4 is at index 1, but the implementation may not return this correctly due to the flawed logic."
exp_4_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle cases where the maximum integer that meets the criteria is not the highest integer in the list. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because 1 appears once, which is equal to its value, but the function incorrectly returns 5 since it has a higher value but does not meet the frequency requirement. Additionally, the function uses 'lst.count(num)' which is inefficient for larger lists, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2). A more efficient approach would be to use a dictionary to count frequencies first."
exp_4_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'strange_sort_list' function does not correctly handle the case where there are duplicate minimum or maximum values in the list. For example, when the input is [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not alternate correctly between the minimum and maximum values due to the way it removes elements from the list. The function modifies the original list, which can lead to incorrect results when duplicates are present. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the list has only one element correctly, as it will not return the single element in the expected alternating order. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_4_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not correspond to any valid method for calculating the area of a triangle based on its side lengths. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle given its three sides (a, b, c) is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433. Therefore, the function does not return the correct area for valid triangles and fails the test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly check if the list is balanced (palindromic). The condition 'if q == q[::-1]' is checked after the sum condition, which means that if the sum exceeds 'w', it will not check for balance. Additionally, the function should return False if the list is not balanced, regardless of the sum. The logic should ensure that both conditions (being a palindrome and the sum being less than or equal to 'w') are satisfied before returning True."
exp_4_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The logic in the second loop incorrectly assumes that the number of changes needed is simply the count of mismatches, but it does not account for the fact that each mismatch requires a change. The function should return the total number of mismatches instead of decrementing from 'min_changes'. This leads to incorrect results for certain test cases, such as 'smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])' which should return 4, but the current implementation does not correctly compute this."
exp_4_HumanEval/74,HumanEval/74,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the total number of characters in the two lists is the same. According to the function description, if both lists have the same total number of characters, the function should return the first list. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' is incorrect because the total number of characters in both lists is the same (8 characters each), but the function would return the second list instead of the first. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."
exp_4_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. However, the implementation only checks if the number is prime itself, returning True for prime numbers and False for non-prime numbers. This does not fulfill the requirement of checking for the multiplication of three primes. For example, is_multiply_prime(30) correctly returns True, but is_multiply_prime(8) incorrectly returns True, as 8 is not the product of three distinct primes. Additionally, the assertion for 125 should return False, as it is not the product of three primes. The logic for checking the multiplication of three primes is missing entirely."
exp_4_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will result in a NameError. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is not sufficient to cover all cases where x is a simple power of n. For example, it will incorrectly return False for cases where x is 1 and n is any positive integer, as 1 is a power of any number (n^0 = 1). Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True' is incorrect because 9 is indeed a power of 3 (3^2 = 9), but the implementation would return False due to the flawed logic. Overall, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if x is a simple power of n."
exp_4_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it does not accurately determine if an integer is a perfect cube. The expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' checks if the cube root of 'a' is an integer by looking at the fractional part, but this approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the implementation may not handle this correctly. A more reliable method would be to calculate the integer cube root and then cube it to check if it equals 'a'."
exp_4_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'hex_key' contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the condition in the if statement checks for the characters 'A', 'B', 'E', and 'D', but it should only check for 'A', 'B', 'D' since 'E' is not a prime hexadecimal digit according to the problem statement. Therefore, the function will not return the correct count of prime hexadecimal digits as specified in the comments."
exp_4_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the conversion of decimal numbers to binary when the binary representation is less than 8 bits. The implementation pads the binary string with zeros to ensure it is always 8 bits long, which is not consistent with the requirement to return the binary representation as is, with 'db' characters added at the beginning and end. For example, decimal_to_binary(1) should return 'db1db', but it would incorrectly return 'db00000001db'. Additionally, the test case for decimal 103 is incorrect because the expected binary representation is not padded to 8 bits, which is inconsistent with the function's logic."
exp_4_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct. The loop and condition used in the function do not properly evaluate all sets of 3 consecutive characters in the string. Instead, it incorrectly compares non-overlapping segments of the string. For example, in the string 'iopaxioi', the segments 'iop', 'opa', and 'pax' are not checked correctly, leading to incorrect results. The correct approach should involve checking each triplet of characters in a sliding window manner to ensure they are distinct."
exp_4_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values that are exactly equal to the thresholds defined in the grading table. For example, a GPA of 3.7 should yield 'A', but the current implementation yields 'A+' for 4.0 and 'A' for values greater than 3.7, which is correct. However, it fails to assign 'B+' for a GPA of 3.0 and 'C+' for a GPA of 2.0, as it uses '>' instead of '>=' for those thresholds. The test cases provided will not pass for GPAs that are exactly on the boundary values."
exp_4_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,True,INCORRECT,"The function `prime_length` is intended to determine if the length of a given string is a prime number. However, it incorrectly identifies prime lengths due to a flaw in the prime-checking logic. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to `string_length`, but it should only check up to the square root of `string_length` for efficiency. Additionally, it fails to handle the case where `string_length` is 2 correctly, as it will return False for lengths of 2, which is a prime number. The test cases reveal that the function incorrectly returns True for strings of lengths that are not prime (e.g., 'world' which has length 5, and should return True, but the function logic is flawed). Therefore, the implementation does not correctly identify prime lengths for all test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for counting n-digit integers that start or end with 1 is inefficient as it checks all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1, which is not necessary. Instead, a mathematical approach should be used to calculate the count directly based on the number of digits. The test assertions also assume the function is correct, but due to the aforementioned issues, the function will not return the expected results."
exp_4_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the sum of the digits of the binary representation of the input integer N, converted to a binary string. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the sum of the binary digits as a decimal integer, rather than the binary representation of that sum. For example, for N = 150, the sum of the binary digits is 6, which should be returned as '110' (the binary representation of 6), but the function currently returns '6' (the decimal representation). Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for the provided test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the function would return 5 + 7 = 12 instead of 122, which is the correct sum of even numbers at odd indices (only 122). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_4_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not preserve the spaces between words in the output. The implementation concatenates the ordered words without any spaces, which results in a string that does not match the expected output. For example, 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation would return 'Hello!!!Wdlor', losing the space between 'Hello' and 'World!!!'. Additionally, the function does not handle punctuation correctly, as it does not separate punctuation from words when sorting. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."
exp_4_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'get_row' does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the problem statement. The current implementation concatenates two sorted lists: one sorted by rows in ascending order and another sorted by columns in descending order. This results in an incorrect final output. The correct approach should sort the coordinates first by row in ascending order and then, for each row, sort the coordinates by column in descending order. Therefore, the output does not match the expected results in the provided test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of using the values at the first and last indices of the array, it uses the indices themselves (0 and len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior for arrays with more than one element. For example, for the array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last index values is 0 + 6 = 6 (even), which would incorrectly lead to sorting in descending order, while the expected behavior is to sort based on the values 2 and 6, which would also yield an even sum but should not affect the sorting order. The test cases that rely on the correct sum of the first and last values will fail."
exp_4_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the encrypt function does not correctly rotate the letters by four places as described in the function's docstring. The function currently shifts letters by two places instead of four. For example, the input 'hi' should return 'lm' (correct), but 'faewfawefaewg' should return 'jeiajeaijeiak' (incorrect). The expected output for 'faewfawefaewg' should be 'jeiajeaijeiak' if shifted by four places, but the implementation does not achieve this. Therefore, the assertions in the check function will fail for multiple test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,True,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is the same as the smallest element. For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the function returns 1, which is incorrect because the second smallest element does not exist (all elements are the same). The function should return None in this case. Additionally, the test case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) is expected to return -35, but the correct second smallest element is 12, which is not handled correctly by the current implementation."
exp_4_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the way sentences are split does not account for the fact that splitting by multiple delimiters will create empty strings in the list. This could lead to incorrect counting of boredoms. The function should use a regular expression to split the string by all three delimiters and then check if each trimmed sentence starts with 'I'. The test cases also indicate that the function does not handle cases correctly, such as counting multiple sentences starting with 'I' in the same string."
exp_4_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' has several issues. Firstly, it uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will cause a NameError. Secondly, the check for whether the numbers are integers is done incorrectly; 'y.is_integer()' and similar calls will raise an AttributeError since 'y' is a float and does not have an 'is_integer' method. Instead, the function should check if each number is an instance of 'int'. Additionally, the logic for checking if one number equals the sum of the other two is correct, but the implementation fails due to the aforementioned issues."
exp_4_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. Instead of replacing the vowel with the correct letter, it incorrectly appends the character from the original message at the index (i + 2) modulo the length of the message. For example, in the test case 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the implementation does not do this correctly. Additionally, the output of the test cases does not match the expected results, indicating that the function does not fulfill the requirements as specified in the comments."
exp_4_HumanEval/94,HumanEval/94,False,CORRECT,"The implementation correctly identifies the largest prime number in the list and returns the sum of its digits. The function 'is_prime' is assumed to be correctly implemented, as it is not provided but is essential for determining primality.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the dictionary contains non-string keys correctly, as it should return False in such cases. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."

However, the test case 'assert candidate(7) == [2,3,5]' is incorrect as it should return [2,3,5] but the function does not limit the count to the first n primes. The test case 'assert candidate(10) == [2,3,5,7]' is also incorrect as it should return the first 4 primes, which is [2,3,5,7]. The function needs to be modified to limit the number of primes returned to n."

Similarly, multiply(19, 28) should return 72 (9 * 8), but the test expects 72, which is correct. However, the test case for multiply(14, -15) expects 20, but the actual result is 5 (4 * 5).

Specifically, the logic used to determine the closest integer is flawed. The candidates list is created based on the values immediately surrounding the input, but it only includes integers that are exactly one less, equal to, or one more than the input. This means that for cases like '14.5' and '-14.5', the function will not correctly identify the need to round away from zero, as it does not consider the actual distance to both integers. Instead, it uses the max function with a key that calculates the absolute distance, which does not guarantee the correct behavior for equidistant cases. For example, for '14.5', the candidates would be [14, 15], and the function would return 14 instead of 15. Additionally, the test assertions indicate that the function is expected to return -16 for '-15.5', which it would not do correctly either. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

Additionally, the implementation does not filter out numbers outside the range of 1 to 9 as specified in the function description. The mapping of integers to their corresponding names also needs to handle the case where the integer is not in the range of 1 to 9, which should be ignored instead of returning an empty string.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the minimum sub-array is not contiguous correctly. For example, the test case minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3, 2, -10]) should return -14, but the current implementation may not yield this result due to the way it calculates sub-array sums. The approach is inefficient with a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the repeated summation of sub-arrays, which can be improved using a more efficient algorithm like Kadane's algorithm."

Additionally, the expected outputs in the test cases do not match the sorting criteria described in the function's docstring. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the assertion in the test case checks for [1, 2, 4, 3, 5], which is incorrect.

Firstly, the condition to check if an element has at most two digits is incorrect; it should check if the absolute value of the number is less than 100, not just the length of its string representation. Secondly, the use of '++' is invalid in Python; it should be replaced with 'count += 1' to increment the count variable. Additionally, the sum of elements with at most two digits is not being calculated correctly, as the current implementation sums all elements regardless of their digit count. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the day is 0 or negative, which should also return False. The checks for the number of days in months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are redundant since they are already covered by the check for days being between 1 and 31.

The function should return a list of words split on commas, but it currently returns a list of ASCII values of lowercase letters instead. Additionally, the function does not correctly return the count of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet; it returns a list instead. The test cases also indicate that the function does not handle cases with mixed punctuation correctly, and it fails to return the expected results for some assertions, such as the empty string case and the case with lowercase letters. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

Therefore, the function fails to return 'YES' for this case. Additionally, the function does not define 'max_of_two_intervals' and 'min_of_two_intervals', which would lead to a runtime error.

The product of signs should be calculated as the product of all individual signs (1, -1, or 0) of the numbers in the array, but the current implementation simply assigns 0 to any number that is 0, which leads to incorrect results when there are zeros in the input array. For example, in the case of 'prod_signs([0, 1])', the expected output is 0, which is correct, but for 'prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])', the expected output is -10, which is incorrect because the product of signs should be -1 (due to -1 in the array), and thus the result should be -10.

Additionally, the recurrence relation for odd n is incorrectly defined; it should use tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n - 3) instead of tri(n + 1). The test assertions also expect floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 8.0), which are not consistent with the expected integer outputs of the Tribonacci sequence.

Instead, it should be initialized to 1 to correctly compute the product of odd digits. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= 10' should use integer division (i.e., 'n //= 10') to avoid losing the integer nature of 'n'. As a result, the function fails to return the correct product of odd digits, leading to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."

The logic used to determine if a bracket is nested is flawed. Specifically, the variable 'nested' is set to True whenever an opening bracket '[' is encountered, but it is immediately set to False when a closing bracket ']' is encountered, regardless of whether the closing bracket is actually closing a nested structure. This leads to incorrect results for cases like '[[]]' and '[[][]]', which should return True but may not due to the flawed logic.

Additionally, the logic for squaring the numbers is incorrect as it uses a syntax that is not valid in Python. The correct implementation should round each number in the list using 'math.ceil', square it, and then sum the results.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the string representation of a number is invalid (e.g., 'abc'). This could lead to a ValueError that is not caught properly. The test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, such as comparing a float with a string that cannot be converted to a float."

The correct approach should consider that the smallest sum of 4 positive even numbers is 8 (2 + 2 + 2 + 2), and any even number greater than or equal to 8 can be expressed as such. The function fails for inputs like 10, 12, and 16, which should return True, but the logic does not account for combinations of even numbers beyond the first four. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly evaluate the condition as described."

However, the input 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow' should return 'Yellow_Yellow_Dirty_Fellow' but it returns 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow', which is incorrect. The function also does not handle leading spaces correctly, as seen in the test case '   Exa 1 2 2 mple', which should return '-Exa_1_2_2_mple' but fails to do so due to the incorrect handling of leading spaces.

It should check if the first character is a letter and that the entire substring is not empty. Lastly, the function does not correctly enforce the limit of three digits in the filename, as it only counts the total number of digits without checking their distribution in the filename.

However, the test assertions include expected MD5 hashes for 'A B C' and 'password' that do not match the actual MD5 hashes generated by the function. The expected hash for 'A B C' is incorrect, and the expected hash for 'password' is also incorrect. Therefore, the implementation is not validated correctly by the provided tests."
exp_4_HumanEval/163,HumanEval/163,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b'. The range function generates numbers from 'a' to 'b' in ascending order, which means if 'a' is greater than 'b', it will not generate any numbers, resulting in an empty list. However, the expected output for 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should be [2, 4, 6, 8], which is not produced by the current implementation. Additionally, the test case 'generate_integers(132, 2)' is expected to return [2, 4, 6, 8], but it will also return an empty list due to the same issue. The function needs to handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b' by swapping the values or adjusting the range accordingly."
exp_5_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,The implementation of the function 'has_close_elements' does not correctly check if any two numbers are closer than the given threshold. The condition 'if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold' does not account for the absolute difference between the two numbers. It should be 'if abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i]) < threshold' to ensure that the distance is correctly evaluated regardless of the order of the numbers. This flaw leads to incorrect results for certain test cases.
exp_5_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly separate the groups of parentheses. It appends the 'group' to 'groups' every time a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, but it does not reset 'group' properly when encountering spaces or when groups are nested. This leads to incorrect results when the input contains spaces or multiple groups. For example, the input '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' should return ['()', '(())', '(()())'], but the current implementation would not handle the spaces correctly and would not produce the expected output."
exp_5_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'truncate_number' is incorrect because the method 'modf()' is not used correctly. The 'modf()' function returns a tuple where the first element is the fractional part and the second element is the integer part. The code assigns 'integer_part' to the first element and 'decimals' to the second element, which is the opposite of what is intended. Therefore, the function returns the integer part instead of the decimal part, leading to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the withdrawal to the balance. The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' for negative values to properly decrease the balance. This leads to incorrect results for cases where withdrawals exceed deposits, causing the function to return False when it should return True."
exp_5_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is correct in calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) based on the provided definition. However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD calculations. For example, the expected result for mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) should be 0.666... (2/3), but the assertion checks for 2/3 which is not the correct MAD. Similarly, the expected results for the other test cases are also incorrect. Therefore, while the function itself is correct, the tests do not validate it properly."
exp_5_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements of the input list. The current logic appends the delimiter after every odd index and also at the end of the list if the last index is reached. This results in an incorrect output for cases where the list has an odd number of elements or when the last element should not be followed by a delimiter. For example, 'intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)' should return [2, 2, 2, 2] but the current implementation would return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] instead."
exp_5_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. The variable 'count' is being incremented and decremented correctly, but the function does not track the maximum depth reached during the iteration through each group. Instead, it simply appends the final value of 'count' to the results list, which will not reflect the maximum depth of nesting. Additionally, the increment operator '++' is invalid in Python; it should be replaced with 'count += 1'."
exp_5_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_substring is designed to filter strings containing a given substring. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']' is incorrect because the expected output should include 'xxx' and 'xxxAAA', but it should not include 'xxx' multiple times. The correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA'] without duplicates. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is also incorrect because 'grunt' does not contain 'run'. The expected output should be an empty list. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all test cases correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' incorrectly calculates the product of the numbers. When the list contains a zero (e.g., [100, 0]), the product should be 0, but the current implementation will return 0 only if the list contains a zero. In the case of an empty list, the function correctly returns (0, 1), but for lists with non-zero elements, the product calculation fails when zero is present. Therefore, the function does not handle the product correctly in all cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It initializes an empty list 'max_elements' and iterates through the input list 'numbers'. For each element, it compares the current number with the last recorded maximum and appends the greater of the two to 'max_elements'. The provided test cases in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various scenarios, including edge cases like an empty list and lists with decreasing values."
exp_5_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' does not correctly implement the logic to find the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. Specifically, the logic for finding the longest palindromic postfix is flawed. The loop checks for palindromic substrings starting from the end of the string, but the slicing used in 'string[i:]' does not correctly identify the longest palindromic suffix. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are incorrectly checking the 'is_palindrome' function instead of the 'make_palindrome' function. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. The XOR operation should ideally consider the entire length of both strings, padding the shorter one with zeros on the left if necessary. For example, for inputs '111000' and '101010', the expected output should be '010010', which is correct, but if the lengths differ, the function will only process up to the length of the shorter string, potentially leading to incorrect results for other cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function longest is incorrect because it does not handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. According to the function's description, if there are multiple strings with the same length, it should return the first one encountered. However, the current implementation only updates longest_string when it finds a string longer than the previous maximum, which means it will not return the first string of maximum length if it appears after a longer string. For example, in the test case longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']), the expected output is 'yyy' since it is the first string of maximum length (4), but the function will return 'zzzz' instead."
exp_5_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test assertions in the check function cover various cases, including coprime numbers (3, 7), a case with a common divisor (10, 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49, 14), and a case with larger numbers (144, 60). All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected and returns the correct GCD for the given inputs."
exp_5_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,True,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 1 to the length of the string plus one, correctly slicing the string to obtain each prefix. The provided test assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various input cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_5_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' is incorrect because it does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The use of ''.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) concatenates the numbers without any delimiter, resulting in a string like '012345...' instead of the expected '0 1 2 3 ...'. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for inputs greater than 0."
exp_5_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters correctly counts the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The implementation uses set to collect unique characters after converting the string to lowercase, which aligns with the function's description. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and strings with mixed case, and all assertions pass successfully."
exp_5_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical notation. The function currently treats each character individually, which leads to incorrect interpretations of the notes. For example, it does not recognize 'o|' as a half note (2 beats) but instead treats 'o' and '|' separately, resulting in incorrect output. The correct implementation should identify 'o', 'o|', and '.|' as whole, half, and quarter notes respectively, and return the corresponding beats accordingly."
exp_5_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error: '++' is not a valid operator in Python for incrementing a variable. It should be 'count += 1' instead of 'count++'. Additionally, the logic for counting overlapping occurrences is flawed because the index is incremented by only 1 after finding a substring, which may skip potential overlapping occurrences. For example, in the string 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', the function should find 'aa' at indices 0 and 1, but it would miss the second occurrence due to the way the index is incremented."
exp_5_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_numbers' is incorrect because the sorting key used in the lambda function, 'int(x[1:])', does not correctly convert the string representations of the numbers ('zero' to 'nine') into their corresponding integer values. Instead, it attempts to convert the substring starting from the second character, which results in incorrect sorting. For example, 'three' would be treated as 'ree', which cannot be converted to an integer, leading to a ValueError. The correct approach would be to map the string representations to their integer values using a predefined dictionary or list."
exp_5_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly identify the closest elements in the list. The nested loops only consider pairs where the first number is less than the second, which means it will miss pairs that are closer together but in reverse order. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the closest elements are actually 3.9 and 4.0, but the function does not account for pairs where the first number is greater than the second. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest elements are equal, as seen in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', where it should return (5.0, 5.0) but does not. Therefore, the logic needs to be revised to check all pairs without the restriction of ordering."
exp_5_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum values are the same. In such cases, the denominator (max_num - min_num) becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. This is evident in the second test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]', which is expected to return [1.0, 0.0] but will fail due to the incorrect assumption that the values will always be different."
exp_5_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension combined with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various input scenarios, confirming that it behaves as expected. All assertions pass, indicating that the function is functioning correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate various cases, including an empty string and non-empty strings, and all assertions pass successfully. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_5_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is intended to find the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. However, the implementation contains a logical error. Specifically, when the divisor reaches 1, the function incorrectly returns n instead of 1. This is not consistent with the expected behavior as shown in the docstring and the test assertions. For example, for n = 3, the expected output is 1, but the current implementation would return 3. Therefore, the function does not correctly fulfill its purpose."
exp_5_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'i++', which is not valid in Python. The correct increment operation should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be replaced with 'n //= i' to ensure that 'n' remains an integer during factorization. These issues will prevent the function from executing correctly and producing the expected results."
exp_5_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each number. For example, in the test case candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output is [1, 4, 5] because 2 and 3 occur more than once and should be removed entirely. The current implementation does not achieve this, as it would return [1, 4, 5] correctly, but fails to remove all occurrences of 2 and 3. Thus, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly implements the logic to flip the case of each character in the input string. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character, applying 'upper()' to lowercase characters and 'lower()' to uppercase characters.

All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings based on the given prefix. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function are incorrect. The expected output for the second assertion should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] but the actual output will be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] which is correct. The issue lies in the test case where the prefix 'xxx' is used, and the expected output does not match the actual output. Therefore, the test assertions do not validate the function correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is intended to return only positive numbers from the input list. However, the second test assertion in the check function fails.

The issue is that the function does not account for zero as a non-positive number, which should not be included in the output. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function correctly identifies prime numbers based on the provided definition. It handles edge cases such as numbers less than or equal to 1, and it efficiently checks for factors up to the square root of 'n'.

exp_5_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function assumes that the polynomial is of the form ax^2 + bx + c, where it only calculates the zero for a quadratic polynomial using the formula -b/(2a). However, the function is supposed to handle polynomials of any degree with an even number of coefficients. The provided test cases and the description suggest that it should find a root for higher degree polynomials as well, but the current implementation does not account for that. Therefore, it does not correctly find the zero of the polynomial for all cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead, it sorts the entire list and then replaces every third index with the corresponding value from the sorted list, which is not the intended behavior. The correct approach should involve extracting the values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back into their original positions in the list."
exp_5_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to remove duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the elements, which aligns with the provided docstring and the test assertion.

However, the test case in the check function contains an assertion that expects the maximum value from the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10] to be 124, which is incorrect. The actual maximum value in that list is 124, but the previous test case with 123 is correct. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the implementation is not being validated correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fizz_buzz function contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' in the numbers divisible by 11 or 13 is incorrect. The function should count how many times the digit '7' appears in the string representation of those numbers, but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results as indicated in the test assertions."
exp_5_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the values at the even indices of the list. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted even indices back to the first even index, rather than assigning the sorted values to all even indices.

exp_5_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion inside the 'check' function is checking if 'candidate(encoded_str) == str', which implies it is expecting the decoding function to return the original string when given the encoded string. However, it is passing 'encode_cyclic' as the candidate, which does not decode the string but encodes it. Therefore, the test will always fail, indicating that the implementation of the decoding function is not being validated correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_fib' is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the current implementation only checks the first n Fibonacci numbers and returns the first one that is prime. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly iterate through all Fibonacci numbers to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number. For example, when n=6, the function returns 233, which is correct, but for n=7, it should return 1597, which is also correct. However, the function does not handle cases beyond the pre-defined list of Fibonacci numbers, and it will fail for larger values of n. Additionally, the function does not correctly implement the logic to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number as it prematurely returns upon finding the first prime Fibonacci number instead of continuing to count until the n-th one is found."
exp_5_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' does not correctly identify distinct elements when checking for combinations of three numbers that sum to zero. The use of the 'seen' set is flawed because it prevents the function from considering valid combinations of numbers that could sum to zero if they are distinct. For example, if the list contains the numbers 1, -1, and 0, the function would not find this valid combination because it would add elements to 'seen' and skip valid combinations. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct results for certain inputs."
exp_5_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'car_race_collision' contains several logical errors and syntax issues. Firstly, the use of 'collisions++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Secondly, the logic used to determine collisions does not accurately reflect the problem description. The number of collisions should be calculated based on the number of cars moving in opposite directions, which would simply be n * n (since each car from the left can collide with each car from the right). The test assertions expect the output to be n^2, but the current implementation does not produce the correct results as it does not correctly count the collisions based on the described scenario."

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect; the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test cases do not match the expected behavior of the function, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation of the implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it calls itself recursively with two arguments, but the function is defined to take only one argument.

exp_5_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from base 10 to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is incorrect for the intended functionality. The 'int(x, base)' function expects 'x' to be a string representation of a number in the specified base, but 'x' is provided as an integer. Additionally, the 'format' function with 'x' as the format specifier converts the number to hexadecimal, not to the specified base.

The expected results for these cases should be '0' and '1' respectively, as 2^30 modulo 5 equals 4 and 2^31 modulo 5 equals 3.

Additionally, the modulo operation is not correctly applied to handle characters that wrap around the alphabet. Therefore, the test assertions in the check function will fail."
exp_5_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels does not correctly handle uppercase vowels. The vowels string only contains lowercase vowels ('aeiou'), so when it checks for vowels using char.lower() not in vowels, it fails to account for uppercase vowels ('AEIOU').

The test cases also include a case with repeated elements (e.g., [4, 1, 1, 0]), which should not be considered monotonically decreasing according to the strict definition. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the intended logic."

Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because the final value of 'n' returned may not be the largest prime factor if 'n' is not reduced to 1. The function should also ensure that the final value of 'n' is checked to see if it is greater than the last factor found. The test cases in the 'check' function also include numbers that are not guaranteed to be composite, which may lead to incorrect assertions."

However, the assertion for candidate(11) which expects 66 is incorrect; the correct sum from 1 to 11 is 66. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the correctness of the implementation is incorrect due to the presence of an incorrect assertion."
exp_5_HumanEval/61,HumanEval/61,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'correct_bracketing' contains a syntax error. The increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with 'open_brackets += 1'.

For example, for the polynomial 3 + 1*x + 2*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 5*x^4, the derivative should be [1, 4, 12, 20], which is correctly shown in the test case. However, the current implementation does not perform this calculation and simply returns the coefficients from the first index onward, which does not yield the correct derivative coefficients."

Specifically, the values for fibfib(5), fibfib(10), fibfib(12), and fibfib(14) should be calculated based on the recursive definition provided, but the current implementation does not yield the correct results for these inputs. For example, fibfib(5) should return 4, but the function does not compute this correctly based on the defined sequence."

Additionally, the logic for counting 'y' as a vowel only at the end of the word is not correctly implemented. The condition 'char.lower()!= 'y' or char.isalpha() and char.lower()!= 'y'' is incorrect and does not properly check if 'y' is at the end of the word. Furthermore, the test cases do not cover all possible scenarios, such as words with no vowels or words that end with 'y'. More test cases are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage."

Instead, it converts the entire string to uppercase and sums the ASCII values of all characters, regardless of whether they were originally uppercase or lowercase. For example, in the case of 'abAB', the function would compute the ASCII values of 'A' and 'B' as 65 and 66 respectively, but it would also compute the ASCII values of 'a' and 'b' as 97 and 98, leading to an incorrect total. The correct approach would be to check if each character is uppercase before adding its ASCII value to the sum."
exp_5_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function fruit_distribution is incorrect because it does not correctly parse the number of apples and oranges from the input string. The line 'total_fruits = s.split(""and"")[1].strip()' attempts to extract the total number of fruits, but it actually retrieves the part of the string after 'and', which is not the correct format. The function should instead extract the numbers of apples and oranges separately, sum them, and then subtract that sum from the total number of fruits 'n'. This leads to incorrect results for the test cases, particularly for cases where the number of apples and oranges is not at the end of the string or when the string format changes."
exp_5_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, the logic to update 'smallest_index' when encountering an even number equal to 'smallest_even' is flawed. The condition 'if i < smallest_index' is unnecessary and incorrect because 'smallest_index' is initialized to -1, which will never be less than any valid index. This means that if the first occurrence of the smallest even number is not the first in the array, it will not be correctly identified. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct index in some scenarios."

For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1, but the function will return 5, which has a frequency of 4, not satisfying the condition (4 < 5). Additionally, the function does not account for the possibility of multiple integers meeting the criteria, and it only returns the maximum integer found, which may not be valid. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The provided implementation of the function `strange_sort_list` does not correctly handle the case where the input list has more than two elements. The logic of alternating between the minimum and maximum values is flawed because it does not account for the fact that after removing the minimum and maximum values, the next minimum and maximum may not be the next in the sorted order. For example, the input [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] should return [5, 9, 6, 8, 7], but the current implementation would not produce this result. Additionally, the function modifies the input list in place, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the original list is needed later. The test cases provided in the `check` function include cases that would fail with the current implementation."

The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not correspond to any valid formula for the area of a triangle given its side lengths. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle using its side lengths is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected results in the test cases do not match the expected area calculations based on valid triangle dimensions."

The function should first check if the list is a palindrome and then check the weight condition."
exp_5_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The current logic only returns the index of the last mismatch instead of counting the number of mismatches. To determine the number of changes required, the function should increment a counter each time a mismatch is found between the elements at positions 'i' and 'length - 1 - i'. The function should return this counter instead of the index."

According to the function's description, if one list is empty and the other is not, it should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in such cases, which is incorrect. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is also incorrect because the total characters in the first list (8) is less than the second list (9), so it should return ['hI', 'hi', 'hii'] instead."

However, the implementation only checks if the number is prime itself and returns False if it is not. This does not fulfill the requirement of checking for the multiplication of three primes. For example, is_multiply_prime(30) should return True, but the current implementation will not correctly identify the product of three primes. Additionally, the test cases include numbers greater than 100, which contradicts the function's constraints."
exp_5_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the return values 'true' and 'false' should be 'True' and 'False' (with capital T and F) in Python. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is not sufficient to handle all cases correctly. For example, it would return False for 'is_simple_power(1, 4)', which should return True since 1 is a power of any number (n^0 = 1). Additionally, the check 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' does not account for cases where x is not a perfect power of n, leading to incorrect results in some assertions. The test cases also include assertions that would fail based on the current implementation, such as 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True', which is incorrect as 9 is indeed a power of 3 (3^2). Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's requirements."

This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for larger integers. For example, the cube root of 1729 is approximately 12.002, and when raised to the power of 3, it does not yield an exact integer. Therefore, the function may return incorrect results for certain inputs. A more reliable method would be to compute the integer cube root and check if cubing that integer returns the original number."
exp_5_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'decimal_to_binary' does not correctly handle the conversion of decimal numbers to binary format. Specifically, it pads the binary representation to 8 bits by adding leading zeros, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', but the function returns 'db00001111db' instead of 'db1111db'. The padding is unnecessary and leads to incorrect outputs for numbers that do not require it. Additionally, the test case for 'decimal_to_binary(103)' is expected to return 'db1100111db', but the function will return 'db11001111db' due to the padding logic. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The current logic checks for distinct groups of three letters but does not ensure that every set of three consecutive letters in the string is distinct from one another. For example, in the string 'iopaxioi', the segments 'iop', 'pax', and 'axi' are not all distinct, leading to an incorrect result. The function should iterate through the string and check each triplet of characters to ensure they are distinct from the previous triplet."
exp_5_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'numerical_letter_grade' does not correctly handle the GPA values according to the specified grading table. Specifically, the condition for GPA values of 1.0 should return 'D' instead of 'D+'. The correct mapping should be: > 1.0 should yield 'D', and exactly 1.0 should yield 'D+'. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for certain test cases, such as 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' which should actually return 'C-'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, it fails to correctly identify prime numbers because it does not handle the case where the string length is 2, which is the smallest prime number. The loop that checks for divisibility starts from 2 and goes up to the length of the string, but it should only check up to the square root of the length for efficiency. Additionally, the function does not return the correct result for strings of length 2, as it will incorrectly return False. The test cases provided also include cases that are not correctly handled by the implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python.

The correct output for N = 150 should be '110' (the binary representation of the sum of digits), but the function is returning the sum itself as a string. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described."
exp_5_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the current implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 88])', the expected output is 88 because 88 is even and at index 1, but the function would return 0 if there were no even numbers at odd indices. The implementation does not fulfill the requirement specified in the docstring."
exp_5_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not maintain the order of words and blank spaces correctly.

The current sorting logic combines two separate sorted lists: one sorted by row in ascending order and another sorted by column in descending order. This results in an incorrect final output. Instead, the coordinates should be sorted first by row in ascending order and then, for each row, by column in descending order. The correct approach would involve sorting the entire list of coordinates based on both criteria simultaneously."
exp_5_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the values rather than the indices. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the indices is 0 + 6 = 6 (even), which would incorrectly trigger a descending sort, while the correct behavior should be based on the values 2 (first) and 6 (last), which sum to 8 (even) and should also trigger a descending sort, but the logic is flawed. The test cases that rely on the sum of values will fail due to this mistake."

However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the new character position. The formula used in the code does not correctly account for the rotation, leading to incorrect outputs for the test cases. For example, the input 'hi' should yield 'lm', but the implementation does not produce the expected results for several test cases, such as 'faewfawefaewg' and 'hellomyfriend'. The assertions in the check function will fail due to these discrepancies."

For example, in the test case next_smallest([1,1,1,1,0]), the expected output is 1, but the function will return None because it checks if lst[1] is not equal to lst[0] after sorting. Additionally, the test case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) will return -35, which is incorrect as the second smallest element should be 12. The function fails to account for duplicates correctly and does not return the correct second smallest value in all scenarios."

Firstly, the function only splits the input string by periods ('.') and does not account for sentences delimited by question marks ('?') or exclamation marks ('!'). This means that sentences ending with '?' or '!' will not be processed correctly. Secondly, the use of '++' for incrementing 'boredoms' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'boredoms += 1'. Lastly, the logic for checking if a sentence starts with 'I' is flawed because it checks each word in a sentence instead of checking the first word directly. Therefore, the function does not correctly count the number of boredoms as described."

For example, for the input 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Additionally, the case swapping logic is not applied correctly in conjunction with the vowel replacement, leading to further discrepancies in the expected output."
exp_5_HumanEval/94,HumanEval/94,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the largest prime number in the list. The function assumes that '0' is not a prime number, which is correct, but it does not handle cases where there are no prime numbers in the list properly.

For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5] (which is correct), but count_up_to(7) should also return [2, 3, 5] (which is correct), but it does not adhere to the requirement of returning the first n primes.

The function should instead check if there are enough even elements in lst2 to replace all odd elements in lst1. For example, the case exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 4]) should return 'YES' because lst2 has even numbers that can replace the odd numbers in lst1, but the current implementation would return 'NO'."

The provided test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including negative numbers, single-element arrays, and zero, all of which are correctly handled by the function. All assertions in the check function pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."

The variable 'buckets' is initialized to the capacity of the bucket, but it is decremented every time a water unit (1) is found in the grid. This means that the function does not correctly account for the fact that multiple units of water can be extracted with a single bucket lowering. Instead, it stops counting once the bucket is empty, which does not reflect the total number of times buckets need to be lowered. The correct approach should involve counting how many total units of water there are in the grid and then dividing that by the bucket capacity to determine the total number of bucket lowerings needed. Therefore, the outputs for the provided test cases will not be accurate."

Additionally, the method 'add' is used on the list 'selected_words', which should be 'append' instead. These errors prevent the function from correctly identifying words with the specified number of consonants, leading to incorrect results for the provided test cases."

Firstly, it incorrectly checks for consonants and vowels by using the indices 'i' and 'i + 1', which leads to incorrect behavior when checking pairs of characters. Specifically, it does not correctly identify the closest vowel that stands between two consonants. For example, in the case of 'FULL', the function should return 'U', but it incorrectly checks the characters in a way that leads to returning an empty string. Additionally, the function converts the entire word to uppercase, which causes it to lose the case sensitivity required by the problem statement. The test cases also include assertions that are not correctly handled by the function, such as 'full' returning 'u' instead of 'U'. Overall, the logic does not align with the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

Additionally, the case 'candidate([5, 15, 0, 3, -13, -8, 0], 7)' returns '[-13, -8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 15]', which is incorrect as it does not sort the maximum elements.

Additionally, the checks for the number of days for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are redundant since they are already covered by the general check for days being between 1 and 31. The function also does not handle the case where the day is 0 or negative, which should return False. Therefore, the implementation does not fully satisfy the requirements outlined in the function description."

The logic for counting lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet is flawed because it returns a list of ASCII values instead of the count of those letters. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that expect a return value of 3 for 'abcdef', but the function will return a list of ASCII values instead of the count. The function also does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as it should return 0 but instead would return an empty list. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

According to the function's description, if a list has more than one duplicate of the same number, it should return False. However, the implementation only checks for duplicates of the current element in the loop, which does not account for duplicates that may exist elsewhere in the list. For example, the input [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] is incorrectly evaluated as True, while it should return False due to the presence of multiple '2's and '3's. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

The algorithm uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach but does not account for the lexicographical order of the paths. It simply visits cells in the order they are queued, which may not yield the lexicographically smallest path. Additionally, the path is constructed by appending values from the grid without considering the order of traversal, leading to incorrect results for the provided test cases. For example, the expected output for the input grid [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] with k = 3 is [1, 2, 1], but the implementation will not guarantee this output due to the lack of proper path management and ordering."

Additionally, the expected outputs in the assertions contain floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 3.0) which are not consistent with the integer outputs expected from the Tribonacci sequence.

Instead, it should be initialized to 1 to correctly compute the product of odd digits. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= 10' should be an integer division (using 'n //= 10') to avoid issues with floating-point numbers. As a result, the function does not return the expected results for the test cases."

For example, in the input '[[]]', the function will return True, but in cases like '[[[[]]]]', it will not correctly identify the nested structure due to the way 'nested' is managed. The function fails to account for multiple levels of nesting and incorrectly returns False for valid nested cases."

Additionally, the logic in the loop that checks each word is flawed. The function should return True only if the last character is a letter and is not part of a word, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this logic.

In the expression '2 + 3 * 4 - 5', the multiplication should be performed before addition and subtraction, resulting in '2 + (3 * 4) - 5' which equals 9. However, the current implementation evaluates operations strictly from left to right without considering precedence, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the expression '2 + 3 * 4' would be evaluated as '(2 + 3) * 4' resulting in 20 instead of the correct 14. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 37' is incorrect as it does not follow the correct order of operations either. The correct evaluation should be '2 ** 3 * 4 + 5' which equals 37, but the implementation does not guarantee this result due to the lack of precedence handling."
exp_5_HumanEval/161,HumanEval/161,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle the case where the string contains no letters correctly. According to the function description, if the string contains no letters, it should reverse the string. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters present. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correct, but if the input were to be something like '!!!', it would return '!!!' instead of reversing it to '!!!'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/162,HumanEval/162,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'string_to_md5' correctly implements the MD5 hashing for non-empty strings and returns None for an empty string. However, the test assertions include expected MD5 hash values that are incorrect for the provided input strings. For example, the MD5 hash for 'A B C' is not '0ef78513b0cb8cef12743f5aeb35f888', and the hash for 'password' is not '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the test cases are flawed, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation."

According to the description, it should return the even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, which implies that it should work regardless of the order of 'a' and 'b'. The current implementation only generates numbers in the range from 'a' to 'b' without considering the case where 'a' is greater than 'b', leading to incorrect results for such inputs. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return [2, 4, 6, 8] but currently returns an empty list. Additionally, the test cases do not cover the scenario where 'a' is greater than 'b' correctly."
exp_6_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,"The function has_close_elements does not correctly check if any two numbers are closer than the given threshold. The condition 'if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold' does not account for the case where the difference could be negative (i.e., when numbers[i] > numbers[j]). It should instead check the absolute difference: 'if abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i]) < threshold'. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs, as seen in the test cases."
exp_6_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly separate the groups of parentheses as specified. The current implementation appends the 'current_group' to 'groups' every time a closing parenthesis is encountered, but it does not handle spaces correctly. The function also does not reset 'current_group' properly when encountering spaces, leading to incorrect groupings. For example, the input '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' should return ['()', '(())', '(()())'], but the current implementation will not produce the expected output due to the way it handles spaces and the grouping logic."
exp_6_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'truncate_number' is incorrect because the method 'number.modf()' is not a valid method for float objects in Python. Instead, the correct approach to obtain the integer and decimal parts of a float is to use 'math.modf()' from the math module or to manually calculate the integer part using 'int(number)' and then subtract it from the original number to get the decimal part. Therefore, the function will raise an AttributeError when called."
exp_6_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When a withdrawal occurs (a negative operation), the code subtracts the operation from the balance, which is incorrect. Instead, it should add the absolute value of the negative operation to the balance. For example, if the operation is -4, the balance should decrease by 4, not increase. This leads to incorrect results in cases where the balance goes below zero due to withdrawals. The test cases that assert the function's correctness reveal this flaw, as the function fails to return the expected results in certain scenarios."
exp_6_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is correct in calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD values. For example, the MAD for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), which is correctly asserted, but the assertion for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] should yield 1.0, which is also correct. However, the assertion for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is incorrect; the expected MAD should be 2.0, not 6.0/5.0 (which is 1.2). Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the tests do not validate it properly."
exp_6_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `intersperse` function does not correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. Specifically, the logic used to append the delimiter is flawed. The condition `if i % 2!= 0 or i!= len(numbers) - 1:` causes the delimiter to be appended incorrectly, leading to extra delimiters being added at the end of the list. For example, calling `intersperse([5, 6, 3, 2], 8)` results in `[5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 8, 2]`, which is correct, but calling `intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)` results in `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, which is incorrect as it should return `[2, 2, 2, 2]` without an extra delimiter at the end. The implementation needs to be revised to ensure that the delimiter is only added between elements and not after the last element."
exp_6_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for calculating the maximum depth of nesting is incorrect. The current implementation only counts the total number of opening and closing parentheses, rather than tracking the maximum depth of nesting. The function should maintain a separate variable to track the current depth and update the maximum depth whenever an opening parenthesis is encountered."
exp_6_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'filter_by_substring' is intended to filter strings that contain the specified substring. However, the test assertions provided in the 'check' function include cases where the expected output does not match the actual output of the function. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']' is incorrect because the expected output should include all occurrences of 'xxx', which would be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx', 'xxx']. Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is also incorrect because 'gruesome' should be included in the output as it contains 'run'. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all test cases."
exp_6_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'sum_product' function is incorrect because the product calculation does not handle the case when the list contains a zero. When multiplying by zero, the product should be zero, but the current implementation will return 1 if the list contains a zero. For example, 'sum_product([100, 0])' should return (100, 0), but it will incorrectly return (100, 1). This violates the expected behavior as described in the function's docstring."
exp_6_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list of integers. The implementation iterates through the list, maintaining the maximum value found so far and appending it to the result list.

The test cases provided in the docstring do not match the expected behavior of the function. For example, 'make_palindrome('cat')' should return 'catac', which is correct, but 'make_palindrome('cata')' should also return 'catac', which is correct. However, the implementation fails to handle cases like 'jerry', where it returns 'jerryrrej', which is not the shortest palindrome. The logic for finding the longest palindromic suffix is flawed, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs."
exp_6_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor does not handle cases where the input strings have different lengths. The XOR operation should be applied to each corresponding bit, and if the strings are of unequal length, the function will only process up to the length of the shorter string, potentially leading to incorrect results. For example, calling string_xor('111000', '101010') should yield '010010', but if the function only processes the first 6 bits, it will not account for any remaining bits in the longer string."
exp_6_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties, but the current implementation only updates 'longest_string' when it finds a longer string, thus ignoring the first occurrence of the longest string when there are ties. For example, in the test case 'check(candidate(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])', the expected output is 'yyy' since it is the first longest string of length 3, but the function will return 'zzzz' instead."

exp_6_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters is intended to count distinct characters in a string regardless of case. However, it does not handle non-alphabetic characters correctly. For example, the test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' should return 5, but it does not account for the fact that the characters are repeated in different cases. The implementation is correct in terms of counting distinct characters, but the test case does not accurately reflect the expected behavior when considering case insensitivity. Additionally, the function does not account for spaces or punctuation, which may lead to incorrect results in some cases."
exp_6_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the musical notes according to the specified legend. The function is treating each character individually instead of recognizing the two-character notes ('o|' and '.|'). As a result, it fails to return the correct list of beats for inputs that include these two-character notes. For example, in the input 'o|', it should append 2 beats instead of 4, and for '.|', it should append 1 beat instead of 1. The test cases that include 'o|' and '.|' will not pass as expected."

exp_6_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sorted() function sorts the words lexicographically (alphabetically), which does not correspond to their numerical values. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, but numerically, four is less than five. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which causes the output to be concatenated without spaces between the words."

For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', the closest numbers are 5.0 and 5.9, but the function will not return them correctly because it does not check pairs where the first number is greater than the second.

The correct output for this input should be [1.0, 0.0] if the numbers are sorted in ascending order, but the function does not handle the order of input correctly. The output should be [1.0, 0.0] for the input [100.0, 49.9], but the function will return [0.0, 1.0] because it does not account for the order of the input list. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as specified in the function's docstring."

But in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output should be [1, 4, 5] because both 2 and 3 occur more than once and should be removed entirely.

exp_6_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode_shift' function is incorrect because it does not properly handle the wrapping of characters when shifting. The calculation for the new character's ASCII value does not account for characters that are beyond 'z'. Additionally, the 'decode_shift' function has a similar issue in its implementation. The modulo operation should be applied after adjusting for the base character ('a'), and the logic for decoding is incorrect. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail, as the encoded string cannot be correctly decoded back to the original string."
exp_6_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is intended to remove vowels from the input string, but it incorrectly handles the case of characters that are not vowels. Specifically, it checks if a character is alphabetic and then checks if its lowercase version is not in the set of vowels. This means that non-alphabetic characters (like digits or punctuation) are not included in the result, which is not the expected behavior according to the test cases. For example, the test case remove_vowels('zbcd') should return 'zbcd', but the implementation does not account for non-vowel alphabetic characters correctly. Additionally, the test case remove_vowels('fedcba') is not covered in the original function's docstring, which could lead to confusion about its expected behavior."
exp_6_HumanEval/52,HumanEval/52,True,CORRECT,"The function 'below_threshold' correctly implements the logic to check if all numbers in the list are below the given threshold.

exp_6_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, meaning they should contain the same unique characters regardless of their frequency. However, the implementation uses 'sorted' to compare the two strings, which checks for both character presence and frequency. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the frequency of characters differs but the unique characters are the same. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return False, which is correct, but 'abcd' and 'dddddddabc' should return False as well, which is also correct. The function fails to meet the requirement of checking for the same unique characters only."
exp_6_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion.

In Python, the increment operator '++' does not exist; instead, it should be 'open_brackets += 1'. This will prevent the function from executing correctly. Additionally, the logic for checking the brackets is correct, but due to this syntax error, the function will not return the expected results."
exp_6_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This means that a list with duplicate elements, such as [4, 1, 1, 0], is incorrectly classified as monotonically decreasing because it allows for equal elements. The correct implementation should use 'greater than' (>) for increasing and 'less than' (<) for decreasing to ensure strict monotonicity. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([4, 1, 1, 0]) == True' is misleading as it suggests that the function should allow equal elements, which contradicts the definition of monotonicity."

exp_6_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operation 'i++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed. The function does not correctly handle the case where the largest prime factor is greater than the square root of n, as it only returns n after the loop, which may not be a prime factor itself. The test cases in the 'check' function also include numbers that are not prime factors of the inputs, leading to incorrect assertions."

exp_6_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial without calculating the actual derivatives. The derivative of a polynomial term ax^n is a*n*x^(n-1). The current implementation does not multiply the coefficients by their respective powers, leading to incorrect results for the test cases. For example, the derivative of 3 + 1*x + 2*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 5*x^4 should yield [1, 4, 12, 20] for the first term, but the implementation does not perform this calculation."
exp_6_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function does not correctly handle the base cases for n=0, n=1, and n=2. The function returns n for n < 3, which means fibfib(0) returns 0, fibfib(1) returns 1, and fibfib(2) returns 2, which is incorrect according to the definition provided in the comments. The correct values should be fibfib(0) == 0, fibfib(1) == 0, and fibfib(2) == 1. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for the test cases, particularly for n=1 and n=2."

The test cases also do not cover all edge cases, such as strings with no vowels or strings that only contain 'y' as a vowel at the end. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_6_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits correctly. According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, it should return the digits reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits, which is correct. However, the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' is incorrect because the expected output should be '00' (the digits reversed) instead of '001'. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the expected behavior for this test case."
exp_6_HumanEval/66,HumanEval/66,True,CORRECT,"The function 'digitSum' correctly calculates the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the input string.

exp_6_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'pluck' function correctly identifies the smallest even value in the array and returns it along with its index. The logic handles multiple occurrences of the same smallest even value by ensuring the first occurrence (smallest index) is returned. The function also correctly returns an empty list when there are no even values or when the input array is empty. All provided test cases pass successfully, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_6_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle cases where the maximum integer that meets the criteria is not the highest integer in the list. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because 1 appears once, which is equal to its value, but the function returns 5 instead, as it is the maximum number in the list. The logic should prioritize finding the maximum integer that meets the frequency condition rather than just the maximum integer overall."
exp_6_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'strange_sort_list' function does not correctly alternate between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. After the first minimum and maximum are added to the result, the function continues to append the minimum of the remaining list without alternating back to the maximum. This leads to incorrect results for lists where the minimum and maximum values are not the only elements left. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should yield [1, 5, 2, 4, 3], but the current implementation will not produce this result correctly. The filtering logic does not ensure that the next value added is the maximum of the remaining integers after each addition."
exp_6_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not correspond to any valid formula for calculating the area of a triangle based on its side lengths. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its sides a, b, and c is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected output for some test cases (like triangle_area(1, 1, 1)) is incorrect based on the area calculation. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_6_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the list is balanced but the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight. Specifically, the function checks if the list is a palindrome after checking the sum, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1] and w is 5, the function would return False because it checks the sum first and does not account for the palindromic condition correctly. The correct order of checks should ensure that both conditions (palindrome and weight) are evaluated properly."
exp_6_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic used to calculate the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is flawed. The loop only checks for mismatches until the first mismatch is found and then breaks, which does not account for all necessary changes. The correct approach should involve counting all mismatches between the left and right halves of the array, rather than stopping at the first mismatch."
exp_6_HumanEval/74,HumanEval/74,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle the case where one list is empty correctly. According to the function description, if one list is empty and the other is not, the empty list should be returned. However, the implementation returns the non-empty list instead. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([], ['this']) == []' fails because the function will return ['this'] instead of []. Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' is incorrect because the total characters in the first list (8) is greater than the second list (8), and according to the function's logic, it should return the first list, which is not the expected output."
exp_6_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. However, the implementation only checks if the number is prime itself and does not account for the multiplication of three primes. The logic in the for loop incorrectly returns False for any non-prime number instead of checking for the specific condition of being a product of three primes. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that expect the function to return True for numbers like 8 and 10, which are not products of three distinct primes, indicating that the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_6_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will raise a NameError in Python. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is problematic because it incorrectly excludes cases where n is 1, which should return True for any x (since 1 raised to any power is 1). Additionally, the logic for checking if x is a power of n is flawed; it should check if n raised to the power of the integer result of the logarithm equals x, but it should also handle cases where x is not a perfect power of n correctly. The test cases provided in the 'check' function also include a case (is_simple_power(9, 3)) that is expected to return True, but the current implementation would not handle it correctly. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_6_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it uses the expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' to determine if 'a' is a perfect cube. This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for large integers. For example, 'iscube(1728)' would not return the correct result because the cube root calculation may not yield an exact integer due to rounding errors. A more reliable method would be to compute the integer cube root and then check if cubing that result returns the original number."
exp_6_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'hex_key' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the string '2357ABED' used in the condition does not correctly represent the prime hexadecimal digits as it includes 'E' which is not prime. The correct prime hexadecimal digits should be '2357BD'. Furthermore, the function does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as it would not return 0 in that case. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."
exp_6_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'decimal_to_binary' does not correctly handle the conversion of decimal numbers to binary format. Specifically, it pads the binary representation with leading zeros to ensure a length of 8 bits, which is not mentioned in the function's description. For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', but the function returns 'db00001111db', which is incorrect. The expected output for 15 should be 'db1111db'. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the binary representation exceeds 8 bits, which could lead to incorrect formatting. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_6_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition of having every 3 consecutive letters being distinct. The loop and condition used in the function do not properly iterate through the string to check all sets of 3 consecutive characters. Instead, it incorrectly compares segments of the string, which leads to incorrect results for various test cases. For example, 'iopaxioi' should return False, but the current implementation may not evaluate this correctly due to its flawed logic."

exp_6_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' is expected to return True if the length of the input string is a prime number. However, the implementation lacks the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is crucial for determining if a number is prime. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that may not align with the expected prime lengths, such as 'HI' (length 2, which is prime) and 'go' (length 2, which is also prime), but the comments suggest that the function should return False for these cases. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_6_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'starts_one_ends' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for counting n-digit numbers is flawed. The range should be from 10**(n-1) to 10**n to ensure that only n-digit numbers are considered. The current implementation counts all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1, which includes numbers with fewer than n digits. Therefore, the function does not correctly count the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1."
exp_6_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is supposed to return the total sum of the digits of the input integer N when represented in binary, but it incorrectly returns the sum as a string representation of the sum of the binary digits instead of the binary representation of that sum. For example, for N = 150, the sum of the binary digits is 6, but the expected output is '110' (which is the binary representation of 6), not '6'. The assertions in the 'check' function are also incorrect based on the expected outputs."
exp_6_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the current implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 88])', the expected output is 88 (since 88 is even and at index 1), which is correct. However, in the test case 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the expected output should be 122 (at index 5) but the function would return 5 (at index 1) instead. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_6_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not maintain the original spacing between words in the input string. When the words are sorted and joined back together, the spaces are lost, leading to incorrect output. For example, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation will concatenate the ordered words without preserving the spaces, resulting in 'Hello!!!Wdlor'. Additionally, the function does not handle punctuation correctly, as it does not sort it separately from the words."
exp_6_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the problem statement. The sorting logic combines two separate sorting operations into one return statement, which results in incorrect ordering. The coordinates should first be sorted by rows in ascending order, and then within each row, they should be sorted by columns in descending order. The current implementation does not achieve this because it concatenates two sorted lists instead of sorting the combined list of coordinates based on the specified criteria."
exp_6_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the values rather than the indices. For example, in the case of 'sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6])', the sum of the first and last values is 8 (even), but the function incorrectly sorts based on the indices, leading to incorrect output."
exp_6_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The function encrypt is intended to shift each letter in the input string by 4 positions down the alphabet (2 multiplied by 2). However, the implementation only shifts by 2 positions. For example, the input 'hi' should return 'lm' (which is correct), but the input 'faewfawefaewg' should return 'jeiajeaijeiak' (which is incorrect because it implies a shift of 4). The test cases provided in the check function reveal that the outputs do not match the expected results for several assertions, indicating that the encryption logic is flawed."

For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the function returns 1, which is incorrect because the second smallest element does not exist (all elements are the same). The function should return None in this case. Additionally, the test case assert candidate([1, 0**0]) == None is misleading because 0**0 is typically considered to be 1, thus this case would not return None.

Additionally, the method of splitting the string into sentences is flawed because it does not properly handle cases where multiple delimiters are used consecutively or where delimiters are at the end of the string. This could lead to incorrect counts of sentences that start with 'I'. Furthermore, the function does not strip leading whitespace from sentences, which could also affect the correctness of the 'startswith' check."

Lastly, the function does not account for the case where any of the three numbers could be equal to the sum of the other two, as it only checks if 'x' equals 'y + z'.

For example, when processing the character 'a', it should replace it with 'c', but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of vowels properly, as it adds an extra character to the encoded message instead of replacing the vowel. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."

However, count_up_to(7) should also return [2, 3, 5] but it does not include 7 as it is not less than 7. The function is not returning the correct number of primes for inputs like 6 and 7. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion for count_up_to(6) which is expected to return [2, 3, 5], but the function does not account for the fact that it should return all primes less than n, not just the first n primes.

For example, when the input is '14.5', the closest integer should be 15, but the logic may not consistently yield this result. Additionally, the test case for '-15.5' is expected to return -16, but the implementation may not handle negative values correctly due to the flawed logic.

The current logic only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order without considering the right shift operation. For example, the input [3, 5, 10, 1, 2] should return True because it can be sorted by shifting elements, but the function incorrectly returns False. The function needs to implement a check that considers the possibility of right shifts leading to a sorted array."

Specifically, the line `num_units = grid[i, :].sum()` is incorrect because it sums the entire row for every water cell, leading to an incorrect count of water units for each individual cell. Instead, it should count the number of 1s in the current row only when a 1 is encountered. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where multiple 1s in a row are counted multiple times, leading to an overestimation of the number of times buckets need to be lowered. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."
exp_6_HumanEval/116,HumanEval/116,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' contains syntax errors and logical issues. Firstly, the use of 'map' is incorrect; it should be 'map' method in Python, not Ruby-style syntax. Secondly, the sorting logic is flawed: it sorts by the negative count of ones, which is incorrect as it should sort by the count of ones in ascending order and then by the decimal value. The test assertions also indicate that the expected output does not match the actual output of the function. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the assertion checks for [1, 2, 4, 3, 5], which is incorrect."

Additionally, the function does not correctly identify the closest vowel between two consonants, as it only checks the next character after finding a consonant pair. The test cases also reveal that the function does not return the expected results for several inputs, such as `full` and `Above`. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

The checks for individual strings being balanced and the total counts of '(' and ')' are insufficient. For example, the input [')())', '(()()('] should return 'Yes' because concatenating them as '(()()()())' results in a balanced string, but the current implementation would return 'No'. The logic needs to account for the order of concatenation and the balance of parentheses at different points in the combined string."
exp_6_HumanEval/120,HumanEval/120,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'maximum' is supposed to return a sorted list of the maximum k numbers in the input array 'arr'. However, the implementation sorts the array in descending order and then returns the first k elements without sorting them in ascending order before returning. This leads to incorrect outputs for the test cases where the expected result is sorted in ascending order. For example, the output for the input '[-3, -4, 5]' with k=3 should be '[-4, -3, 5]', but the function would return '[5, -3, -4]', which is incorrect."

However, the implementation incorrectly counts the number of digits by converting the number to a string and checking its length. This approach fails for negative numbers, as the '-' sign is counted as a digit, leading to incorrect results. For example, in the test case candidate([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3), the expected output is -4, but the function would not correctly handle the negative numbers. Additionally, the test case candidate([11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9], 4) expects a sum of 125, but the correct sum of the first four elements (11, 21, 3, 90) is actually 125, which the function would return correctly.

It allows for 29 days in February without checking if the year is a leap year. Additionally, the function does not properly validate the day for months with 31 days, as it checks for 31 days in all months without considering the specific month. For example, it incorrectly allows '04-31-3000' to pass as valid since it checks for 1 <= day <= 31 without further validation for the month. The function also does not handle the case where the input format is incorrect (e.g., '04-0-2040' should be invalid due to the day being '0'). Therefore, the implementation does not satisfy all the rules outlined in the function description."

According to the function's description, if a list has more than one duplicate of the same number, it should return False. However, the implementation checks for duplicates only at the current index and does not account for the entire list. For example, the input [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] should return False, but the function returns True.

The function currently calculates the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by their respective signs, but it does not account for the overall product of the signs. For example, in the test case 'prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])', the product of signs should be -1 (since there is one negative number), leading to a final result of -10, which is incorrect. The function should first determine the product of the signs (1, -1, or 0) and then multiply this product by the sum of the magnitudes. Additionally, the test case 'prod_signs([-1, 1, 1, 1])' should return -4, but the current implementation would return 4, which is also incorrect."

The algorithm uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach but does not account for the lexicographical order of the paths. It simply visits cells in the order they are added to the queue without considering the values in the cells, which leads to incorrect results. For example, the test case with grid [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] and k = 3 should return [1, 2, 3] instead of [1, 2, 1].

The variable 'odd_digits' is initialized to 0, and the multiplication operation 'odd_digits *= digit' will always result in 0 unless 'odd_digits' is initialized to 1. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= 10' should use integer division (i.e., 'n //= 10') to avoid losing the integer nature of 'n'. As a result, the function does not return the correct product of odd digits, leading to failed assertions in the test cases."

The logic used to track nesting is flawed. The variable 'nested' is set to True when an opening bracket is found, but it is reset to False when a closing bracket is encountered, which does not accurately reflect the nesting structure. For example, in the input '[[[[]]]]', the function would incorrectly return False because it resets 'nested' too early. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where brackets are not properly balanced, which is crucial for determining valid nesting. Therefore, the function fails to pass several test cases, such as '[[[[]]]]' which should return True."

Firstly, the method 'map' is not a valid method for lists in Python; it should be used with the built-in 'map' function or a list comprehension. Secondly, the 'toList()' method does not exist in Python; the result of 'map' should be converted to a list using 'list()'. Additionally, the rounding operation should be applied to each element of the list before squaring them. The correct implementation should use 'math.ceil' correctly and ensure that the squared values are summed properly. Due to these errors, the function will not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."

Additionally, the test case can_arrange([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10]) is expected to return 2, but the function will not return the correct index based on the problem statement.

The correct implementation should check if n can be expressed as the sum of four even numbers, which means n must be at least 8 and even. The test cases provided in the check function indicate that the function should return True for numbers like 10, 12, and 16, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly."

The regex used only checks for a valid format but does not validate the specific conditions outlined in the comments. For example, 'I563_No.exe' should return 'No' because it contains 4 digits, but it currently returns 'Yes'. Additionally, 'this_is_valid.txt' is valid, but the regex does not account for underscores or other characters before the dot, which are not allowed.

The function currently squares the integer at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 3, and cubes it if 'i' is a multiple of 4, regardless of whether 'i' is also a multiple of 3. This means that for indices that are multiples of both 3 and 4 (like 12), the function will incorrectly square the value instead of cubing it. This leads to incorrect results for test cases such as candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) which should yield a different sum based on the correct implementation."

The function fails to return the expected output for the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""' because 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime lengths, but 'available' (9) is not, so the expected output should be 'there is no place', which is correct. However, the function does not handle the case of words with lengths that are not prime correctly. The function also does not define the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for it to work.

Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in an integer.

exp_6_HumanEval/162,HumanEval/162,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'string_to_md5' correctly computes the MD5 hash for the input string and returns None for an empty string. However, the test assertions include expected MD5 hashes for 'A B C' and 'password' that are incorrect. The expected hash for 'A B C' should be 'a3ee1a4e8c8e1b1b1f2e1d4c3c8f5d3b' and for 'password' it should be '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99', which is correct. Therefore, the test cases are not valid, leading to the conclusion that the overall implementation is incorrect due to the faulty test cases."
exp_6_HumanEval/163,HumanEval/163,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b'. According to the function description, it should return even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, but the implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without checking if 'a' is less than 'b'. Therefore, when 'a' is greater than 'b', the function will not return the expected output. Additionally, the test cases provided do not cover the scenario where 'a' is greater than 'b' properly, leading to incorrect assertions."
exp_7_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'has_close_elements' does not correctly check if any two numbers are closer than the given threshold. The condition 'if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold' does not account for the case where 'numbers[i]' is greater than 'numbers[j]', which could lead to a negative difference. The correct condition should be 'abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i]) < threshold' to ensure that the absolute difference is considered. This flaw causes the function to return incorrect results for certain inputs."
exp_7_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'separate_paren_groups' has several issues. Firstly, the function does not correctly handle spaces in the input string, as it does not ignore them when determining the start and end of groups. Secondly, the function incorrectly uses the 'is_balanced' function (which is not defined in the provided code) to check for nested parentheses, but it should instead be focusing on separating balanced groups. The logic for appending to 'groups' is flawed because it appends the substring from 'start' to 'i' before confirming that it is a complete group. Additionally, there is a syntax error with an extra parenthesis in the line checking 'is_balanced(paren_string[start:])'. Overall, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments and fails to pass the provided test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'truncate_number' is incorrect because it uses 'number.modf()' which is not a valid method for float objects in Python. Instead, the correct approach to obtain the integer and decimal parts of a float is to use 'math.modf()' from the math module. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input number is not positive, which contradicts the function's description. Therefore, the function will raise an AttributeError when called."
exp_7_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The function below_zero incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When the operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), it subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the operation to the balance instead of subtracting it. The correct implementation should use 'balance += operation' for negative values, or simply 'balance -= abs(operation)'. This leads to incorrect results for cases where withdrawals exceed deposits, causing the function to return False when it should return True."
exp_7_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is correct in terms of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD values. For example, the MAD for the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), but the assertion checks for 2.0/3.0, which is correct. The assertion for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] should return 1.0, which is correct. However, the assertion for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] should return 6.0/5.0 (1.2), but the assertion checks for the wrong value. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the tests are flawed, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation."
exp_7_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. Specifically, it adds the delimiter after every element except the last one, which leads to an extra delimiter being added at the end of the list. For example, calling 'intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)' should return '[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]', but the current implementation would return '[1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4]', which is incorrect. The logic for appending the delimiter needs to be adjusted to ensure it only adds the delimiter between elements and not after the last element."
exp_7_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. This will cause the function to raise a SyntaxError when executed. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are unmatched parentheses, which could lead to incorrect results. The logic for counting the maximum depth is correct, but due to the syntax error, the function will not run successfully."
exp_7_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_substring' is correct in terms of filtering strings that contain the specified substring. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is incorrect because 'grunt' does not contain the substring 'run', and thus the expected output should be an empty list []. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the test cases do not accurately reflect the expected behavior."
exp_7_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of multiplying numbers correctly when the list contains a zero. The product should be zero if any number in the list is zero, but the current implementation will return 0 only if the list is empty. For example, 'sum_product([100, 0])' should return (100, 0), but the current implementation will return (100, 0) correctly. However, if the list contains only zeros, like 'sum_product([0, 0])', it will return (0, 0) instead of (0, 0). The product should be 0 if there is at least one zero in the list. The test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)' passes, but the implementation is still flawed in general for other cases involving zeros."
exp_7_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of a list of integers. The implementation iterates through the input list and maintains the maximum value encountered so far, appending it to the result list. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the correctness of the implementation, including edge cases such as an empty list and lists with decreasing values. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_7_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'make_palindrome' does not correctly generate the shortest palindrome for all test cases. For example, the test case 'jerry' should yield 'jerryrrej', but the logic used to find the longest palindromic postfix and the subsequent construction of the palindrome is flawed. The function incorrectly identifies the longest palindromic suffix and does not properly append the necessary characters to form the correct palindrome."
exp_7_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is supposed to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. For example, if 'a' is '111000' and 'b' is '101010', the function will only process the first three characters of each string, resulting in '100' instead of the expected '010010'. Therefore, the function does not produce the correct output for all test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle the case of returning the first longest string correctly. According to the function's description, if there are multiple strings of the same maximum length, it should return the first one encountered. However, the implementation only updates the longest_string when it finds a string longer than the current longest, which means it will not return the first longest string in case of ties. For example, in the test case longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']), 'yyy' and 'zzzz' both have lengths of 3 and 4 respectively, but if there were two strings of length 4, it would return the last one instead of the first one."
exp_7_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function validate the implementation against various pairs of integers, and all assertions pass without error. The function returns the expected results for both the provided examples in the docstring and the additional test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,True,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 1 to the length of the string plus one, correctly slicing the string to obtain each prefix. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness for various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming the function behaves as expected."
exp_7_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers. The use of ''.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) results in a concatenated string without any spaces. Therefore, the output for the test case 'string_sequence(5)' would be '012345' instead of '0 1 2 3 4 5'. This discrepancy leads to the failure of the assertions in the 'check' function."
exp_7_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters is intended to count distinct characters in a string regardless of case. However, it does not handle non-alphabetic characters correctly. For example, the test case count_distinct_characters('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') should return 5, but the implementation will treat all characters as distinct due to the way it processes the input. Additionally, the implementation does not account for spaces or punctuation, which may lead to incorrect results in some cases. The expected output for the test case 'Jerry jERRY JeRRRY' should be 5, but the implementation may not handle spaces correctly, leading to potential discrepancies."
exp_7_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the musical notes according to the specified legend. The function treats each character individually, but the notes 'o|', 'o', and '.|' are multi-character strings that should be parsed as single units. The current implementation will not correctly recognize 'o|' and will treat '|' as a separate character, leading to incorrect beat values in the output. For example, the input 'o| o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o' should produce [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4], but the function will not return this due to incorrect parsing."
exp_7_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should use 'count += 1' and 'index += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting overlapping occurrences is correct, but due to the syntax error, the function will not execute properly. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments and will raise an error when called."
exp_7_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_numbers' is incorrect because the sorting logic is flawed. The key function used in the sorting, 'lambda x: int(x[1:])', attempts to convert the string representation of the numbers to integers by slicing off the first character. This does not correctly map the string representations of the numbers ('zero' to 'nine') to their respective integer values. Instead, it should use a mapping from the string names to their corresponding integer values for accurate sorting. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted numbers, which would lead to a concatenated string without spaces."
exp_7_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly identify the closest pair of numbers. The nested loop structure is designed to find pairs of numbers, but it only considers pairs where the first number is less than the second. This means that it will miss pairs that are equal or where the second number is smaller than the first, which can be the closest pair. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', the closest elements are 5.0 and 5.9, but the implementation will not find this pair correctly due to the condition 'numbers[i] < numbers[j]'. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest elements are equal, which is a valid scenario as shown in the test cases. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_7_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'rescale_to_unit' does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum values are the same, which would lead to a division by zero in the expression '(max_num - min_num)'. This situation can occur when all elements in the input list are equal. The test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is also incorrect because it expects the output to be in the order of the input, which is not how the rescaling should work. The correct output should be [1.0, 0.0] for the input [100.0, 49.9] if the function were to correctly rescale the values."
exp_7_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list.

However, the implementation incorrectly returns n when the divisor is less than or equal to 1, which is not the expected behavior. For example, for n = 3, the correct output should be 1, but the function would return 3, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n is 1 correctly, as it would return 1 instead of indicating that there are no divisors smaller than 1."
exp_7_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'i++', which is not valid in Python. The correct increment operation should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be replaced with 'n //= i' to ensure that 'n' remains an integer throughout the factorization process. These issues will cause the function to fail during execution, leading to incorrect results."
exp_7_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once from the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each number. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4] because 2 occurs more than once and should be removed entirely. The implementation does not achieve this, as it retains the first occurrence of 2. The assertion assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == [1, 4, 5] also fails because it incorrectly retains the first occurrences of 2 and 3. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

However, the test assertion check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']) is incorrect because the expected output should include 'xxx' and 'xxxAAA', but it should also include the second 'xxx' as it is a valid match. Therefore, the correct expected output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] instead of ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']."

This will result in a NameError when the function is called. Additionally, the test cases in the check function include assertions for composite numbers that are not correctly handled by the is_prime function, as it does not account for the case where n is a prime number multiplied by another prime number (e.g., 5 * 17). The function should correctly identify composite numbers as false, but it does not handle the edge cases properly due to the missing import."
exp_7_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `find_zero` function is incorrect. The function is supposed to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in the list `xs`. However, the formula used to compute the root, `-xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1])`, is only valid for quadratic polynomials (degree 2) and does not generalize to polynomials of higher degrees. Additionally, the function assumes that the coefficients are structured in a way that guarantees a solution, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description. The test assertions in the `check` function are designed to validate the correctness of `find_zero`, but since the function does not handle polynomials of varying degrees correctly, it will fail for any polynomial with a degree greater than 2."

However, the implementation only checks the first n Fibonacci numbers and returns the first one found in the 'primes' list. This means it will not correctly return the n-th prime Fibonacci number for n > 5, as it does not iterate through all Fibonacci numbers beyond the predefined list. For example, 'prime_fib(6)' should return 233, but the current implementation will not reach that point correctly.

The nested loops allow for the same element to be used multiple times in the sum, which violates the requirement for distinct elements. For example, if the list contains duplicates, the function could incorrectly return True when it should return False. Additionally, the condition to skip elements equal to zero is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results. The function should instead focus on ensuring that the three selected indices are distinct and that their sum equals zero."

Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test case is not validating the function correctly, leading to a failure in the overall correctness of the test suite."
exp_7_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function pairs_sum_to_zero is incorrect because it does not properly check for distinct pairs that sum to zero. The nested loop structure allows for the same element to be used twice (i.e., when i and j are the same), which violates the requirement for distinct elements. For example, if the list contains a zero, the function could incorrectly return True if it finds two zeros, which should not be allowed. Additionally, the logic for checking pairs is inefficient and can be simplified using a set to track the required complements.

The test cases provided in the check function include edge cases that the implementation does not handle correctly, particularly for larger values of n. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate(30, 5) == 4' fails because 2^30 % 5 equals 4, which is correct, but the implementation may not be efficient for larger values.

However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This means that it will return True for lists that contain equal consecutive elements, which is not consistent with the typical definition of monotonicity. For example, the list [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False because it is not strictly decreasing, but the current implementation returns True.

The function should return the largest prime factor found, but it currently returns 'n', which may not be correct if 'n' is prime. The test cases in the 'check' function also include values that are not guaranteed to be non-prime, which could lead to incorrect assertions."

Additionally, the expected outputs for fibfib(10), fibfib(12), and fibfib(14) are not validated by the current implementation, as they are not defined in the code. The function needs to be revised to ensure it correctly computes the FibFib sequence."

Specifically, the logic for updating 'smallest_index' when encountering an even number equal to 'smallest_even' is flawed. The current implementation only updates 'smallest_index' if the index of the current number is smaller than the previously recorded index, which is unnecessary since we are already tracking the smallest even number. The correct behavior should simply return the first occurrence of the smallest even number without needing to check for equality again. This leads to incorrect results in cases where the smallest even number appears multiple times."

The function checks the frequency of each number but does not account for the possibility that a lower number may have a higher frequency than a higher number. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected result is 1 because 1 appears once, which is equal to its value, while 5 appears four times but does not meet the criteria.

For example, in the test case 'candidate([0,2,2,2,5,5,-5,-5])', the expected output is '[-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2]', but the function will not produce this output due to the way it removes elements from the list. Instead, it will only remove one instance of -5 and one instance of 5, leading to an incorrect order in the final result."

Additionally, the method 'round' is incorrectly called on 'area', which should be 'round(area, 2)'. The test cases also indicate incorrect expected results for some inputs, such as triangle_area(1, 1, 1) which should return approximately 0.43 but the calculation is not correct based on the area formula."

exp_7_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The current logic only checks for mismatches and returns the index of the last element that does not match, which does not represent the count of changes needed. The correct approach should count the number of mismatches between the elements from the start and the end of the array, incrementing a counter for each mismatch. This counter should then be returned as the result."

According to the specification, if one list is empty and the other is not, the function should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in this case. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is incorrect because the total character count of both lists is equal (10), so it should return the first list ['hi', 'admin'], which is correct, but the assertion is misleading as it implies the function is correct when it is not. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function description."

For example, is_multiply_prime(30) should return True, but the function will incorrectly return False for numbers like 8 and 10, which are not products of three primes. Additionally, the assertion for candidate(125) should fail since 125 is not a product of three primes (it is 5^3). The logic for checking the multiplication of three primes is missing entirely."

Firstly, it uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will result in a NameError. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is not sufficient to ensure that x is a simple power of n, as it does not account for cases where x is equal to n raised to the power of 0 (which is always 1). Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x is less than n properly, which can lead to incorrect results. The test cases also include assertions that contradict the function's logic, such as 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True', which is incorrect since 9 is 3 squared. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point arithmetic, especially for larger integers. For example, 'iscube(1728)' would incorrectly return False because the cube root calculation may not yield an exact integer due to precision issues. A more reliable method would be to compute the integer cube root and then check if cubing that integer returns the original number."

The current implementation pads the binary representation to 8 bits, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, 'decimal_to_binary(15)' should return 'db1111db', which is correct, but 'decimal_to_binary(0)' should return 'db0db', which is also correct. However, the function does not handle cases where the binary representation is less than 8 bits correctly, as it pads with zeros to always make it 8 bits long.

The condition used in the for loop is flawed; it checks for distinctness between non-overlapping groups of 3 letters instead of checking every group of 3 consecutive letters. This leads to incorrect results for strings that do not meet the criteria. For example, 'iopaxioi' should return False because 'i' appears in the last three letters, but the current implementation would not catch that."

However, the implementation has a flaw in the prime-checking logic. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case where the string length is 2, which is the smallest prime number. The loop starts from 2 and checks divisibility up to 'string_length - 1', which means it incorrectly returns False for strings of length 2. Additionally, the function does not account for the case of string lengths that are less than 2 correctly. The test cases provided include assertions that would fail due to this incorrect implementation."

Additionally, the logic for counting n-digit numbers that start or end with 1 is incorrect. The range should be from 10**(n-1) to 10**n to ensure that only n-digit numbers are considered. The current implementation checks all numbers from 0 to 10**n - 1, which includes numbers that are not n-digit. Therefore, the function will not return the correct counts for the test cases provided."
exp_7_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the sum of the digits of the binary representation of the integer N, but it currently returns the sum as an integer instead of converting that sum to a binary string. The expected outputs in the test cases are binary strings, but the function does not provide the correct outputs. For example, for N = 1000, the sum of the binary digits is 1, which is correct, but for N = 150, the sum is 6, which should be returned as '110', but the function returns 6 as an integer. The same issue occurs for other test cases."

exp_7_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'get_row' does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the function description. The current sorting logic combines two separate sorting operations: first sorting by row in ascending order and then sorting by column in descending order. This results in an incorrect final list of coordinates. Instead, the coordinates should be sorted by row first, and then for each row, the coordinates should be sorted by column in descending order. The correct approach would involve grouping the coordinates by row and then sorting each group by column before concatenating the results."
exp_7_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the values rather than the indices. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last values (2 + 6) is 8 (even), so it should sort in descending order, which it does. However, for the input [21, 14, 23, 11], the sum of the first and last values (21 + 11) is 32 (even), but the expected output is incorrect as it does not match the expected descending order. The test cases that rely on the sum of the values will fail due to this logic error."

Additionally, the function does not check all combinations of the three numbers to see if one is equal to the sum of the other two. The correct checks should include: x == y + z, y == x + z, and z == x + y. As a result, the function will not return the expected results for all test cases."

For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([127, 97, 8192]) == 10', the largest prime is 127, and the sum of its digits should be 1 + 2 + 7 = 10, which is correct. However, the function does not handle cases where the largest prime is not the last number in the list correctly, nor does it handle the case where there are no prime numbers correctly. The function should return 0 in such cases, but it may not do so correctly depending on the input.

The correct approach would be to check if all keys are lower case or all keys are upper case separately, and return True only if one of those conditions is satisfied.

The correct approach would involve checking if the array can be split into two parts where the first part is greater than the second part, and the maximum of the first part is less than or equal to the minimum of the second part. The test case 'move_one_ball([3, 5, 10, 1, 2])' should return False, but the current implementation returns True, indicating a flaw in logic."

The function attempts to exchange elements but does not ensure that all odd numbers in lst1 can be replaced with even numbers from lst2. For example, in the test case exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]), the function returns 'NO', which is correct, but in the case exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 4]), it returns 'YES', which is incorrect because lst1 cannot be made entirely even with the available even numbers in lst2. The logic should ensure that after attempting to exchange, all elements in lst1 are even, which is not guaranteed in the current implementation."

The current logic checks for the most common letters but also incorrectly includes the least common letters due to the second 'if' statement. This leads to incorrect results in cases where there are letters with different frequencies. For example, in the case of 'a b b a', the expected output is {'a': 2, 'b': 2}, but the implementation may not return this correctly due to the flawed logic. The function should only check for the maximum occurrence and return those letters, not the minimum."

Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when trying to call 'is_palindrome(result)'. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include a case where the input string 'a' with character 'a' results in an empty string, which is incorrectly marked as a palindrome. An empty string is considered a palindrome, but the expected output should be ('', True) as per the definition. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The function returns the expected results as specified in the comments and assertions."
exp_7_HumanEval/115,HumanEval/115,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function max_fill does not correctly account for the number of times buckets are lowered based on the capacity. The current logic decrements the bucket count without considering that multiple units of water can be extracted in one lowering if the bucket capacity allows it. The function should calculate how many times buckets need to be lowered based on the total number of 1s (units of water) in the grid divided by the bucket capacity. The current implementation will stop prematurely when the bucket count reaches zero, which does not reflect the requirement to count all units of water in the grid."
exp_7_HumanEval/116,HumanEval/116,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' contains several issues. Firstly, the syntax used for mapping and sorting is incorrect for Python; it appears to be written in Ruby syntax. In Python, the correct way to create a list of tuples would be using a list comprehension. Secondly, the sorting logic is incorrect; it should sort by the number of ones in binary representation in ascending order, and for ties, by the decimal value in ascending order. The test assertions also indicate that the expected output does not match the actual output of the function, which further confirms that the implementation is incorrect."
exp_7_HumanEval/117,HumanEval/117,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains several issues. First, the counting of consonants is incorrect; it currently counts vowels instead of consonants. The line 'count++' is also syntactically incorrect in Python; it should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the method 'selected_words.add(word)' is incorrect because 'selected_words' is a list, and the correct method to append an item to a list is 'selected_words.append(word)'. These issues will lead to incorrect results when the function is executed."

The loop iterates from the end of the word towards the beginning, but the condition to find a vowel between two consonants is incorrectly checking the indices. Specifically, it checks if the current character is a consonant, the next character is a vowel, and the character after that is a consonant. This means it will miss cases where the vowel is immediately followed by a consonant. Additionally, the function converts the entire word to uppercase, which causes it to lose the case sensitivity required by the problem statement. The test cases also reveal that the function does not return the expected results for several inputs, such as 'full' and 'Above'. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the task."

For example, the input ['(()(())', '())())'] returns 'No' due to the count checks, but it is possible to concatenate them in a way that forms a balanced string. The function fails to account for the order of concatenation and the actual structure of the strings, which is necessary to determine if a good string can be formed."
exp_7_HumanEval/120,HumanEval/120,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'maximum' is supposed to return a sorted list of the maximum k numbers in the input array 'arr'. However, it sorts the array in descending order and returns the first k elements without sorting them in ascending order as required by the function's description. For example, the output for the input '[-3, -4, 5], 3' should be '[-4, -3, 5]' but the function would return '[5, -3, -4]'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

However, the implementation iterates over odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) instead of even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases. For example, in the case of solution([5, 8, 7, 1]), the odd element at index 0 (5) should be included in the sum, but it is not due to the incorrect indexing."
exp_7_HumanEval/122,HumanEval/122,True,INCORRECT,"The function add_elements is intended to return the sum of elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of the array. However, the implementation incorrectly counts the number of digits by converting the number to a string and checking its length. This approach fails for negative numbers, as the '-' sign is counted as a digit, leading to incorrect results. For example, in the test case candidate([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3), the expected output is -4 (sum of 1 and -2), but the function would incorrectly sum the first three elements (1, -2, -3) and return -4, which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed for other cases. Additionally, the test case candidate([11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9], 4) expects a sum of 125, but the function would only sum 11, 21, and 3, which totals 35, leading to an assertion failure. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's requirements."

Specifically, the while loop should continue until the last element of collatz_seq is 1, but the condition is not properly set to ensure that the sequence is built correctly. Additionally, the test assertions provided in the check function are incorrect based on the expected output of the Collatz sequence. For example, the assertion for candidate(14) expects [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17], which does not match the odd numbers that would actually appear in the Collatz sequence for 14. The correct odd numbers from the Collatz sequence for 14 should be [1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described."

The current implementation allows for 29 days in February without checking if the year is a leap year. Additionally, the checks for valid days in months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are redundant since they are already covered by the general check for days being between 1 and 31. The function also does not validate the year format or ensure that the input is strictly in 'mm-dd-yyyy' format, which could lead to incorrect validations for other formats."

According to the function's description, if a list has more than one duplicate of the same number, it should return False. However, the implementation only checks if the current number has duplicates, not if any number in the list has more than one duplicate. For example, the input [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] should return False, but it returns True. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/127,HumanEval/127,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the intersection function incorrectly calculates the length of the intersection. The length is defined as 'end - start + 1', which is correct for closed intervals. However, the function fails to recognize that if the intervals touch at a single point (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 3)), the intersection length should be 1, which is not prime. The function returns 'NO' for this case, which is correct, but it also incorrectly returns 'YES' for the intersection of (-3, -1) and (-5, 5), which has a length of 3 (which is prime). The test case 'intersection((-2, 2), (-4, 0))' is also incorrect as it should return 'NO' since the intersection is (-2, 0) with a length of 3, which is prime. Therefore, the function does not handle all cases correctly."

The function currently multiplies each magnitude by its corresponding sign, but it does not take into account that the overall sign of the result should be determined by the product of all signs in the array. For example, in the case of 'prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])', the expected output is -10, but the function does not correctly handle the sign product, leading to incorrect results for some test cases."

The variable 'odd_digits' is initialized to 0, and the product is calculated using multiplication. However, multiplying by 0 will always yield 0, which means that the function will never return a correct product of odd digits. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= 10' should be 'n //= 10' to ensure integer division. This leads to incorrect results for all test cases that involve odd digits."

The variable 'nested' is set to True when an opening bracket is encountered, but it is reset to False when a closing bracket is found, which does not accurately reflect whether the brackets are nested. For example, in the input '[[]][[', the function would incorrectly return True because it only checks if there was a previous opening bracket without ensuring that it is closed properly before encountering another opening bracket. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct results for several test cases."

Firstly, the method 'map' is not a valid method for lists in Python; it should be replaced with a list comprehension or the 'map' function. Secondly, 'math.ceil' should be imported from the math module, and the rounding operation should be applied correctly to each element in the list. Additionally, the syntax for squaring the elements and summing them is incorrect. The correct approach should involve using a list comprehension to round, square, and then sum the values.

Additionally, the test case can_arrange([1,2,4,5]) is expected to return -1, which is correct, but the logic fails for other cases. The function should be revised to ensure it correctly identifies the largest index as specified in the function description."

In the implementation, the condition for updating `pos_int` is incorrect; it should check if the number is greater than `pos_int` instead of less than. This leads to incorrect results for cases where there are positive integers present. For example, in the test case `largest_smallest_integers([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, -2])`, the expected output is (-2, 1), but the function will return (-2, None) because it fails to update `pos_int` correctly."

For example, '2,3' is converted to 2.3, but when comparing '1' (which becomes 1.0) with 1, it returns None instead of the expected behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the inputs are equal but represented differently (e.g., '1' and 1).

It only checks if n is equal to the sum of the first four positive even numbers (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20). However, the task requires checking if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The correct implementation should consider all combinations of four positive even numbers that sum to n, rather than just checking against a fixed sum. Therefore, the assertions in the check function will not yield the expected results for all cases."

The function currently only calculates the regular factorial of 'n', which is 'n!'. However, the Brazilian factorial requires the product of all factorials from 'n!' down to '1!'. Therefore, the correct implementation should involve a loop that calculates the factorial for each integer from 'n' down to '1' and multiplies them together.

For example, the test case 'Mudasir Hanif ' should return 'Mudasir_Hanif_' but instead it would return 'Mudasir-Hanif_' due to the incorrect handling of single spaces. Additionally, the test case 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow' should return 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow' but it would not due to the same issue.

The first character should be checked directly instead. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the file name has more than one dot correctly, as it only checks the count of dots after checking for digits. This leads to incorrect results for some test cases, such as 'this_is_valid.txt' which should return 'Yes' but may not due to the flawed logic. Furthermore, the function does not correctly handle cases where the substring after the dot is not one of the allowed extensions.

This leads to incorrect results for test cases where indices are both multiples of 3 and 4. For example, at index 12, the value should be cubed (if it were not also a multiple of 3), but the current implementation will square it instead. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030' is incorrect based on the function's logic, which leads to further discrepancies in the expected output."

However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' is expected to return an empty string, which is correct. The issue arises with the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""', where 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime lengths, but the implementation does not account for the word 'available' (9), which is not prime.

Specifically, when the total (number + need) is greater than remaining, the function should return the total eaten carrots as 'number + remaining' and the remaining carrots as '0'. However, it incorrectly returns 'remaining' instead of '0' when the total is less than or equal to remaining. This leads to incorrect outputs for the test cases provided."
exp_7_HumanEval/160,HumanEval/160,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'do_algebra' does not correctly handle the order of operations (operator precedence). For example, in the test case with operators ['**', '*', '+'] and operands [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is calculated as 2 ** 3 * 4 + 5, which should yield 37. However, the function evaluates the operations strictly from left to right without considering that exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication and addition. This leads to incorrect results in cases where operator precedence matters."
exp_7_HumanEval/161,HumanEval/161,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains no letters. According to the problem statement, if the string contains no letters, the function should reverse the string. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correct, but the function fails to handle cases like '!!!' where it should return '!!!' as it contains no letters, but it would return an empty string instead."
exp_7_HumanEval/162,HumanEval/162,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_to_md5' is correct in terms of returning the MD5 hash for the given input string and returning None for an empty string. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function include expected MD5 hash values that are incorrect for the provided inputs. For example, the MD5 hash for 'A B C' and 'password' do not match the expected values in the assertions. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the tests do not validate the function properly due to incorrect expected values."
exp_7_HumanEval/163,HumanEval/163,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b'. The expected behavior is to return the even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, but the implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without considering the order. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return an empty list, but the function will not handle this case correctly. Additionally, the test cases are incorrect; 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return [] but the assertion expects [2, 4, 6, 8]. The function also does not account for the case where 'a' and 'b' are equal, which should return [a] if 'a' is even or an empty list if 'a' is odd."
exp_8_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'has_close_elements' does not correctly check if any two numbers are closer than the given threshold. The condition 'if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold' does not account for the absolute difference between the two numbers. It should use 'abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i]) < threshold' instead. As a result, the function may return incorrect results for certain inputs, failing the provided test assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'separate_paren_groups' contains several issues. Firstly, the function does not correctly handle the separation of groups of parentheses. The logic for appending to the 'groups' list is flawed; it appends the substring from 'start' to 'i' whenever it encounters an opening parenthesis, which does not accurately reflect the balanced groups. Additionally, the function incorrectly checks for balance using 'is_balanced' without defining this function, leading to a NameError. Furthermore, the final check for balance has an extra closing parenthesis, causing a syntax error. The test cases provided in the 'check' function expect the output to be a list of separate balanced groups, but the current implementation does not achieve this."
exp_8_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'truncate_number' is incorrect because the method 'modf()' returns a tuple where the first element is the decimal part and the second element is the integer part. The code incorrectly assigns 'integer_part' to the first element and 'decimals' to the second element, leading to the wrong return value. The correct implementation should return 'integer_part' instead of 'decimals'."
exp_8_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the operation to the balance instead of subtracting it. The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' for negative values, or 'balance -= abs(operation)'. This leads to incorrect balance calculations and incorrect results for certain test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is correct in terms of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD values. For example, the expected result for mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), which is correct, but the assertion checks for a value of 2.0/3.0, which is correct. The second assertion is also correct, as the MAD for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] is indeed 1.0. However, the third assertion's expected value of 6.0/5.0 (1.2) is incorrect; the correct MAD for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is 1.2. Therefore, the overall evaluation is INCORRECT due to the incorrect expected values in the assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. The logic used in the for loop causes the delimiter to be added incorrectly. Specifically, the condition 'if i % 2 != 0 or i != len(numbers) - 1' leads to the delimiter being added after the last element, which is not intended. For example, calling 'intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)' results in '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]' instead of the expected '[2, 2, 2, 2]'. The correct approach would be to append the delimiter only between elements and not after the last element."
exp_8_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct syntax for incrementing a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. This will prevent the function from executing correctly. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are unmatched parentheses, which could lead to incorrect results. The logic for counting the maximum depth is otherwise correct, but the syntax error needs to be fixed for the function to work."
exp_8_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_substring' is incorrect because it does not correctly filter strings based on the presence of the substring. The test case 'check' includes assertions that expect the function to return strings that contain the substring, but the implementation uses 'substring in string', which is correct. However, the expected output for the test case 'check' is incorrect. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is incorrect because 'gruesome' also contains 'run'. Therefore, the expected output does not match the actual output of the function."
exp_8_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. While it initializes 'sum_' to 0 and 'product' to 1, the product calculation in the loop will not execute for an empty list, leading to the product remaining 1, which is correct. However, when the list contains a zero (as in the test case [100, 0]), the product should be 0, but the current implementation will incorrectly return 0 for the product when it should return 1 for the empty product case. The assertion 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)' fails because the product should be 0, not 1."
exp_8_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of a list of integers. It initializes an empty list 'max_elements' and iterates through the input list 'numbers'. For each element, it compares the current element with the last recorded maximum (stored in 'max_elements') and appends the greater of the two to 'max_elements'. The provided test cases in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various scenarios, including an empty list, a strictly increasing list, a strictly decreasing list, and a list with mixed values. All assertions pass, indicating that the function is implemented correctly."
exp_8_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' does not correctly implement the logic to create the shortest palindrome from the given string. The test cases provided in the 'check' function are meant to validate 'make_palindrome', but the assertion for 'check(is_palindrome)' is incorrect as it is testing the wrong function. Additionally, the logic for finding the longest palindromic postfix and constructing the palindrome is flawed. For example, the case 'jerry' should yield 'jerryrj' instead of 'jerryrrej'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. The XOR operation should be applied to each corresponding bit, and if the strings are of unequal length, the function currently only processes up to the length of the shorter string, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, calling string_xor('111000', '101010') should yield '010010', but if the implementation does not account for the remaining bits in the longer string, it will not produce the expected output."
exp_8_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle the case of returning the first longest string correctly when there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. For example, in the test case 'check(candidate(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']) == 'zzzz')', the function should return 'yyy' instead of 'zzzz' because 'yyy' appears first and has the same length as 'zzzz'. The implementation fails to account for this requirement."
exp_8_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'greatest_common_divisor' function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function cover various cases, including coprime numbers (3 and 7), multiples (10 and 15), and a case with a common divisor (49 and 14). All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,True,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 1 to the length of the string plus one, correctly slicing the string to create each prefix. The provided test assertions cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, and they all pass as expected."
exp_8_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function string_sequence is incorrect because it does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The join method is called on an empty string, which results in the numbers being concatenated without any delimiters. The correct implementation should use ' '.join(...) to ensure that the numbers are space-delimited."
exp_8_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters is intended to count distinct characters in a string regardless of case. However, the test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' should return 6 distinct characters ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') but it returns 5 due to incorrect handling of the input. The implementation does not account for the fact that 'c', 'a', 'd', and 'e' are repeated in different cases, leading to an incorrect count. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_8_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The function parse_music does not correctly parse the musical notes according to the specified format. The implementation treats each character individually instead of recognizing the patterns 'o', 'o|', and '.|'. As a result, it incorrectly appends beats for 'o|' and '.|' notes. For example, 'o|' should yield 2 beats, but the current implementation would treat 'o' and '|' separately, resulting in incorrect output."
exp_8_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should use 'count += 1' to increment the count. Additionally, the logic for finding overlapping substrings is correct, but due to the syntax error, the function will not execute properly. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_numbers' is incorrect because the sorting key used in the lambda function 'key=lambda x: int(x[1:])' does not correctly convert the string representations of the numbers into integers. Instead, it attempts to convert the substring starting from the second character, which will lead to a ValueError since the strings do not start with a digit. The correct approach should map the string representations of the numbers to their corresponding integer values for proper sorting. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted numbers, which will concatenate them without spaces."
exp_8_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the closest elements in all cases. Specifically, the distance calculation does not account for negative distances, and the closest pair is not guaranteed to be returned in sorted order. For example, in the test case `find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])`, the closest elements are `3.9` and `4.0`, but the function would return `(2.0, 2.2)` instead, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function should sort the pair before returning it to ensure the smaller number comes first."
exp_8_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum values are the same. In such cases, the denominator (max_num - min_num) becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. This is evident in the second test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]', which is expected to return [1.0, 0.0] but will fail due to the incorrect assumption that the function will always produce valid outputs for any input list."
exp_8_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_integers' correctly filters a list to return only the integers. The use of list comprehension with 'isinstance(value, int)' effectively checks each element's type.

exp_8_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is intended to find the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n. However, the implementation has a flaw: when the divisor reaches 1, it incorrectly returns n instead of 1. This is evident in the test cases where inputs like 3 and 7 should return 1, but the current implementation would return 3 and 7 respectively. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."
exp_8_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'i++', which is not valid in Python. The correct increment operation should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be replaced with 'n //= i' to ensure integer division, as we are dealing with factors. These issues will prevent the function from executing correctly and returning the expected results."
exp_8_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once from the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each number. For example, in the test case candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output is [1, 4, 5], but the function will return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] instead. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not meet the specified requirement."
exp_8_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each alphabetic character in the input string while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

Therefore, the expected output in the assertion does not match the actual output of the function."
exp_8_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is designed to return only positive numbers from the input list.

exp_8_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function is supposed to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in the list 'xs'. However, the formula used to calculate the root, '-xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1])', is only valid for quadratic polynomials (degree 2) and does not generalize to polynomials of higher degrees. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the polynomial has multiple roots or does not have a real root. The test cases provided in the docstring also imply that the function should handle polynomials of varying degrees, which it currently does not. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The requirement is to sort the values at indices that are divisible by three while keeping the other values unchanged.

For example, in the test case sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]), the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the implementation does not achieve this because it uses the sorted version of the entire list instead of just the values at the specified indices."

The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted even-indexed elements to each even index, rather than replacing each even index with the sorted values in the correct order. This leads to incorrect results, as seen in the provided test cases."

The assertion should check if 'decode_cyclic' correctly decodes the encoded string back to the original string. Additionally, the implementation of 'decode_cyclic' is identical to 'encode_cyclic', which means it will not correctly decode the string. The logic for encoding and decoding should be different, as decoding should reverse the encoding process."

The implementation only checks the first few Fibonacci numbers (up to the 10th) and does not generate Fibonacci numbers beyond the hardcoded list. Additionally, the logic for checking if a Fibonacci number is prime is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that if a Fibonacci number is not found in the primes list, it is prime without proper primality testing. This leads to incorrect results for inputs greater than 5, as seen in the test assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the distinctness of the elements being considered for the sum. The use of the 'seen' set is flawed; once an element is added to 'seen', it prevents the same element from being used in subsequent iterations, which is not the intended behavior. The function should check for distinct elements only when forming the triplet (a, b, c) and not restrict the selection of elements based on previous selections. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the same number can be part of different combinations. For example, the input [1, 3, -2, 1] should return True because 1, -2, and -1 can form a valid triplet, but the current logic may skip valid combinations due to the 'seen' set logic."

Firstly, the syntax for incrementing the 'collisions' variable is incorrect; it uses '++' which is not valid in Python. It should be 'collisions += 1'. Secondly, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The function does not correctly simulate the conditions under which cars collide, as it relies on incorrect comparisons and breaks out of loops prematurely. The expected output for the test cases is based on the assumption that each car from one direction collides with every car from the opposite direction, which should yield n*n collisions.

Additionally, the `decode_shift` function has a similar issue. The test assertions in the `check` function are designed to validate the decoding process, but since the encoding function is flawed, the decoding will also fail. Therefore, the overall implementation does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."

exp_8_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, but it only checks if they have the same characters in the same frequency. The test cases provided suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True since they both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', but the current implementation returns False because of the frequency mismatch."
exp_8_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a recursive approach. The provided test assertions validate the function against known Fibonacci values, including edge cases. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected for the tested inputs."

Additionally, 'else if' should be replaced with 'elif'. These issues will prevent the function from executing correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when checking for balanced brackets."
exp_8_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons, which means it will return True for lists that contain equal elements as well. This is not consistent with the typical definition of monotonicity, which usually requires strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequences. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False because it is not strictly decreasing. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/58,HumanEval/58,True,CORRECT,"The function 'common' correctly identifies the unique common elements between two lists by converting them to sets, computes their intersection, and then returns a sorted list of these elements. The provided test assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with common elements, lists with no common elements, and lists with duplicates, all of which return the expected results."
exp_8_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator 'i++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case when the remaining value of 'n' is a prime number itself after the loop. The function should return the largest prime factor found, which may not be the final value of 'n' if it is greater than 1. The test cases also include numbers that are not guaranteed to be composite, which could lead to incorrect assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n is intended to sum all integers from 1 to n. The implementation uses the formula n * (n + 1) / 2, which is mathematically correct for calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers. However, the test assertion check(candidate) includes an assertion for candidate(6) == 21, which is incorrect because the correct sum from 1 to 6 is 21. Therefore, the code fails to pass all assertions, indicating that the implementation is not correct."
exp_8_HumanEval/61,HumanEval/61,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains syntax errors. Specifically, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be 'open_brackets += 1'.

The derivative of a polynomial is computed by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and reducing the power by one. For example, for the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the correct derivative should be [1*1, 2*2, 3*4, 4*5] which results in [1, 4, 12, 20]. However, the current implementation simply returns the coefficients starting from the second element, which does not reflect the correct derivative calculation."
exp_8_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function is incorrect because it does not return the expected values for the FibFib sequence. Specifically, the base cases are not handled correctly. The function returns 'n' for inputs less than 3, which is not aligned with the expected output of fibfib(0) == 0, fibfib(1) == 0, and fibfib(2) == 1. The correct implementation should return 0 for fibfib(0) and fibfib(1), and 1 for fibfib(2). The test cases in the check function will fail for fibfib(0) and fibfib(2) due to this issue."
exp_8_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not account for uppercase vowels, as the string 'vowels' is defined in lowercase. The test cases also do not cover all scenarios, such as words with 'y' at the end or mixed case inputs. Therefore, the function will not return the correct counts for all inputs as described in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits. According to the description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is greater than or equal to the length of the digits. This causes the function to return incorrect results for cases where the shift is exactly equal to the number of digits, such as in the test case 'circular_shift(12, 2)', which should return '12' but is handled correctly. However, the test case 'circular_shift(100, 2)' returns '001', which is incorrect because the expected behavior for a shift of 2 should be to reverse the digits, resulting in '001'. Thus, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_8_HumanEval/66,HumanEval/66,True,CORRECT,"The function 'digitSum' correctly calculates the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the input string. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and mixed-case strings, and the function returns the expected results for all assertions. The logic of iterating through each character, checking if it is uppercase, and summing their ASCII values using 'ord' is implemented correctly."
exp_8_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, it does not update the smallest index correctly when encountering an even number that is equal to the current smallest even number. The condition 'elif node % 2 == 0 and node == smallest_even' is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4 ,8]) == [4, 1]', the function would return [4, 3] instead of the expected [4, 1] because it does not properly track the first occurrence of the smallest even value. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle cases where the maximum integer that meets the criteria is not the highest integer in the list. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because 1 appears once, which is equal to its value, but the function returns -1 instead. Additionally, the function uses 'lst.count(num)' which is inefficient as it traverses the list multiple times, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2). A more efficient approach would be to use a dictionary to count frequencies in a single pass."
exp_8_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'strange_sort_list' function does not correctly handle the case where there are duplicate minimum or maximum values. For example, in the case of the input [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not produce this result because it removes the first occurrence of the minimum and maximum values without considering duplicates. This leads to incorrect ordering in the output."
exp_8_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not yield the correct area for a triangle given its three sides. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle using its sides is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for the triangle with sides (1, 1, 1) should be approximately 0.43, but using Heron's formula, it should be approximately 0.866, which is not returned by the current implementation."
exp_8_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the list is balanced but the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight. Specifically, the function checks if the list is a palindrome after checking the sum against the weight, but it does not ensure that both conditions (being a palindrome and the sum being less than or equal to the weight) are satisfied before returning True. The function will return True if the list is a palindrome, regardless of the sum condition, which is incorrect. For example, the input [1, 2, 1] with weight 5 should return True, but it would return False due to the sum being 4, which is less than the weight but the function does not check for the sum condition before confirming it's balanced."
exp_8_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `smallest_change` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The logic only checks for the first mismatch and returns the number of changes based on that single mismatch, which is incorrect. For example, in the case of `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])`, the function returns 4, but it does not account for all mismatches throughout the array. The correct approach should involve counting all mismatches between the elements from the start and the end of the array until the middle is reached, and each mismatch would require one change. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/74,HumanEval/74,True,INCORRECT,"The function total_match does not handle the case where one list is empty correctly. According to the specification, if one list is empty and the other is not, the function should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in such cases, which is incorrect. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is incorrect because the total character count of the first list (10) is greater than that of the second list (9), so it should return ['hI', 'hi', 'hii'] instead."
exp_8_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_multiply_prime' does not correctly determine if a number is the product of three prime numbers. The current logic only checks if 'a' is prime by testing divisibility from 2 to 'a-1' and returns True if 'a' is prime, which is not the intended functionality. The function should instead factor 'a' and check if it can be expressed as a product of exactly three prime numbers. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that are not valid based on the function's description, such as 'assert candidate(8) == True' (8 = 2 * 2 * 2, which is not a product of three distinct primes) and 'assert candidate(125) == True' (125 = 5 * 5 * 5, which is also not a product of three distinct primes). Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_8_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will result in a NameError. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is incorrect because it excludes cases where n is 1, which should return True for any x (since n**0 = 1). Additionally, the logic for checking if x is a simple power of n is flawed; it does not account for cases where x is not an exact power of n. The test cases provided in the 'check' function also include assertions that would fail based on the incorrect implementation, such as 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True', which is false since 9 is 3**2. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the intended logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' incorrectly checks if a number is a perfect cube. The expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' does not reliably determine if 'a' is a perfect cube due to floating-point precision issues. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the test case checks 'candidate(1728)', which is not the same. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly, as the cube root of a negative number is also negative, and the current implementation does not account for this. A correct approach would involve checking if the cube of the integer part of the cube root equals the original number."
exp_8_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'hex_key' contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python.

The correct prime hexadecimal digits should be '2357BD', where 'B' represents 11 and 'D' represents 13. Therefore, the count of prime hexadecimal digits will not be accurate, leading to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'decimal_to_binary' does not correctly handle the conversion of decimal numbers to binary strings with the required formatting. Specifically, it pads the binary representation to 8 bits by adding leading zeros, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', which should be padded to '00001111' to make it 8 bits long, resulting in 'db00001111db' instead of 'db1111db'. Additionally, the function does not account for numbers greater than 255, which would exceed the 8-bit representation. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct.

Additionally, the condition 'all(s[j:j + 3] != s[j + 3:j + 6] for j in range(0, len(s) - i + 1))' is flawed as it does not ensure that all sets of 3 consecutive characters are distinct. Instead, it only compares non-overlapping groups of 3 characters, which is not the requirement. Therefore, the function will fail for various test cases, such as 'iopaxioi', which should return False but may not due to the incorrect logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'numerical_letter_grade' does not correctly handle the GPA values according to the grading table provided in the comments. Specifically, the function incorrectly assigns the letter grade 'D+' for a GPA of 1.2, while it should assign 'D'. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where a GPA of exactly 0.0 should return 'E', which is correctly handled in the test cases. The test cases also include a GPA of 1.2, which should return 'D', but the function does not implement this correctly."
exp_8_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prime_length' is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if a number is prime. Specifically, it fails to check for divisibility by numbers greater than 1 and less than the square root of the string length. For example, the string length of 9 (from 'kittens') is incorrectly identified as prime because the function checks divisibility only up to 8. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the string length is 2 correctly, as 2 is a prime number but would return False due to the loop starting from 2 and not checking for divisibility. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function that depend on the correctness of 'prime_length' will yield incorrect results."
exp_8_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'starts_one_ends' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic used to count the numbers that start or end with '1' is flawed because it does not correctly account for the range of n-digit integers. The range should be from 10**(n-1) to 10**n, not from 0 to 10**n. Therefore, the function will not return the correct counts for the test cases provided."
exp_8_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the sum of the digits of the binary representation of N, but it incorrectly returns the sum as a binary string. For example, for N = 150, the binary representation is '10010110', and the sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0) is 6, which should be returned as '110' in binary. However, the function returns '6' as a string instead of '110'. The test cases in 'check' also expect incorrect outputs based on the function's logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices in the list. However, the implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the case of 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the function would return 5 + 7 = 12 instead of 122, which is the only even number at an odd index. The test cases provided in the 'check' function do not validate the requirement of summing only even numbers at odd indices, leading to incorrect results."
exp_8_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function anti_shuffle does not maintain the spaces between words in the output. When the words are sorted and joined together without spaces, the original structure of the sentence is lost. For example, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation will return 'Hello!!!Wdlor', which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle punctuation correctly, as it does not sort punctuation marks separately from words."
exp_8_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the requirements. The current implementation concatenates two sorted lists: one sorted by row in ascending order and another sorted by column in descending order. Instead, the coordinates should be sorted first by row in ascending order and then, for each row, by column in descending order. This means that the sorting should be done in a single step, not by combining two separate sorts."
exp_8_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices. This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the values at the first and last indices. For example, in the case of the array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the first index value is 2 and the last index value is 6, which sum to 8 (even), but the function incorrectly sorts based on the indices instead, leading to incorrect output."

However, the implementation only shifts by 2 positions. For example, 'h' should become 'l' (shifted by 4), but the implementation correctly shifts it to 'j' (shifted by 2). The test cases provided also expect the output based on a 4-position shift, which leads to failures in the assertions. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_8_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,True,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is the same as the smallest element. For example, in the test case next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected result is None since there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the test case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -35 as the second smallest element, but the function will return -45 instead, as it does not account for the ordering correctly after sorting. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function description."

Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will lead to a NameError. Secondly, the check for whether the numbers are integers is done incorrectly; it uses 'is_integer()' method which is valid for float objects but not for integers. The function should check if all inputs are instances of 'int' instead. Lastly, the logic for checking if one number equals the sum of the other two is correct, but due to the aforementioned issues, the function will not work as intended."

Additionally, the function does not define the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for it to work. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_8_HumanEval/95,HumanEval/95,False,INCORRECT,"The function check_dict_case does not correctly handle the case where the dictionary contains non-string keys.

The test case check_dict_case({'p':'pineapple', 5:'banana', 'a':'apple'}) should return False, but the implementation will raise an error instead. Additionally, the test case check(candidate({'fruit':'Orange', 'taste':'Sweet'})) is incorrectly labeled as 'Fourth test error' in the assertions, which is misleading. The function should also return False for this case since the keys are not all in the same case.

However, for multiply(19, 28), the expected output is 72, but the unit digits are 9 and 8, which gives 72, so this is correct. The test case multiply(14, -15) should return 20 (unit digits are 4 and 5, which gives 20), which is also correct. However, the test case multiply(76, 67) should return 42 (unit digits are 6 and 7, which gives 42), which is correct. The test case multiply(17, 27) should return 49 (unit digits are 7 and 7, which gives 49), which is also correct. The edge cases are also handled correctly.

Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results."
exp_8_HumanEval/108,HumanEval/108,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'count_nums' contains several issues. Firstly, the use of 'count++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'count += 1'. Secondly, the method 'toString()' does not exist for integers in Python; instead, 'str(num)' should be used to convert the number to a string. Additionally, the method 'digits()' is not a valid method for strings in Python; to iterate over the digits, one should simply loop through the string representation of the number. Furthermore, the logic for counting signed digits in negative numbers is flawed; it should consider the absolute value of the number when summing the digits. Lastly, the test cases provided in the 'check' function do not align with the expected behavior described in the comments, particularly regarding how negative numbers are handled."
exp_8_HumanEval/109,HumanEval/109,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'move_one_ball' does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by right shifts. The current logic checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not the requirement. The function should instead check for the number of 'breaks' in the order of the array. A valid array that can be sorted via right shifts will have at most one point where the order breaks (i.e., where an element is greater than the next). The current implementation fails to account for this and will incorrectly return True for arrays that cannot be sorted by right shifts."
exp_8_HumanEval/110,HumanEval/110,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where lst1 has odd numbers and lst2 has no even numbers available for exchange. The inner loop only breaks when an even number is found in lst2, but if lst2 has no even numbers, the outer loop continues to the next odd number in lst1 without returning 'NO'. This leads to incorrect results in cases where lst1 cannot be made entirely even. For example, the test case exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3]) should return 'NO' but the implementation would incorrectly return 'YES' because it does not check if all odd numbers in lst1 can be exchanged with even numbers in lst2."

Specifically, when the input string s is equal to the characters in c, the function returns an empty string, but it incorrectly evaluates this empty string as a palindrome (it should return False instead of True). For example, the test case check(candidate) with the input ('a', 'a') should return ('', False) instead of ('', True). This discrepancy indicates that the palindrome check is not correctly implemented."

The current logic decrements the 'buckets' variable without resetting it for each row, which means that once the buckets are exhausted, it will not continue to count the remaining water in the subsequent rows. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are more wells than the bucket capacity allows for in a single pass, leading to an incorrect total count of times the buckets need to be lowered."

Firstly, the use of 'map' and 'zip' is incorrect for Python; it seems to be written in Ruby syntax. In Python, the correct method to use would be a list comprehension or the 'map' function directly. Secondly, the sorting logic does not correctly account for the number of ones in the binary representation as specified in the function description. The expected output for the test cases does not match the actual output produced by the function, indicating that the sorting is not performed as required. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the implementation does not produce this result."

Additionally, the logic to find the closest vowel is flawed; it incorrectly checks the vowel at word[i + 1] instead of looking for a vowel that is between two consonants. The test cases also reveal inconsistencies, such as 'full' returning 'u' instead of 'U', and 'Above' returning 'o' instead of 'A'. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the comments."

However, the input ['(()(())', '())())'] would return 'No' even though it can be rearranged to form a good string. The function fails to consider the order and nesting of parentheses, which is crucial for determining if the strings can be concatenated to form a balanced string."

The test case is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) should return False, but the implementation returns True. Additionally, the check for duplicates is done using lst.count(lst[i]), which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results when duplicates are present. A better approach would be to use a set to track seen numbers."

The test case 'assert candidate((1, 2), (1, 2)) == ""NO""' fails because the expected output should be 'NO' since the length of the intersection is 1, which is not prime.

Specifically, if any number in the array is zero, the product of the signs will be zero, which will lead to the final result being zero regardless of the magnitudes. This is incorrect based on the requirement that the product of signs should be 1 for positive numbers, -1 for negative numbers, and 0 if any number is zero. The test case 'prod_signs([0, 1])' should return 0, which is correct, but the test case 'prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])' should return -9, which is also correct, but the logic fails for other cases where the signs are mixed with zeros. The test case 'prod_signs([-1, 1, 1, 1])' should return -4, but it will return 0 due to the sign product being zero. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The logic used to determine if a bracket is nested is flawed. The variable 'nested' is set to True when an opening bracket '[' is encountered, but it is reset to False when a closing bracket ']' is encountered, which does not accurately track whether a bracket is nested. For example, in the case of the input '[[]]', the function will return True correctly, but for inputs like '[[][]]', it will return False incorrectly because it does not recognize that there are nested brackets. The test cases reveal that the function fails to handle various scenarios correctly, particularly those involving multiple levels of nesting."

Specifically, the condition checking if the last character is not part of the previous words is flawed. For example, in the case of 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed not part of any previous word, but the implementation incorrectly checks this by looking for 'e' in the concatenated string of previous words without spaces. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs, such as 'apple pi e' returning True, which is correct, but 'apple pi e ' returning False, which is also correct, but the logic is not sound for all cases. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string has trailing spaces correctly."

However, the requirement states that if the values are equal, None should be returned only if they are of the same type. Since one is a string and the other is an integer, the function should return the larger value instead of None. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where both inputs are strings correctly if they contain commas, as it converts them to floats but does not check for equality in their original string forms."

Specifically, 'isalpha()' should be used to check if the first character is a letter, and the length of the substring should be checked to ensure it is not empty. Additionally, the extension check does not account for the case where the extension is empty, which should also return 'No'. These issues lead to incorrect evaluations for some test cases."

This leads to incorrect results for test cases where the index is both a multiple of 3 and 4. For example, at index 0 (which is both), the function squares the value but does not cube it as it should. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030' is expected to fail because the correct output should be calculated based on the rules provided in the function's description."

The issue arises in the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""', where 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime, but 'available' (9) is not, so the expected output should be 'there is no place' which is correct.

However, the test case 'compare([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])' expects the output to be [2,0,0,1], but the implementation will return [2,0,0,1] which is correct.

In a right-angled triangle, the longest side (hypotenuse) must be compared against the squares of the other two sides. The correct implementation should first identify the longest side and then apply the Pythagorean theorem accordingly. For example, in the case of 'right_angle_triangle(10, 6, 8)', the function incorrectly returns True because it assumes 'c' is the hypotenuse without checking if '10' is the longest side."

exp_8_HumanEval/159,HumanEval/159,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'eat' function does not correctly calculate the total number of eaten carrots and the remaining carrots after meals. The logic for calculating 'total' is flawed. It adds 'remaining' to 'number' instead of considering how many carrots the rabbit can actually eat based on the 'need' and 'remaining' values. For example, in the case of 'eat(4, 5, 1)', the rabbit needs 5 carrots but can only eat 1 more, leading to a total of 5 eaten carrots and 0 remaining, which is not correctly handled in the code."
exp_8_HumanEval/160,HumanEval/160,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'do_algebra' does not correctly handle the order of operations (operator precedence). For example, in the test case with operators ['**', '*', '+'] and operands [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is calculated as 2 ** 3 * 4 + 5, which should yield 37. However, the current implementation evaluates the expression strictly from left to right, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach would require evaluating the expression considering operator precedence, which is not implemented in the current code."
exp_8_HumanEval/161,HumanEval/161,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation does not handle the case where the string contains no letters correctly. According to the function description, if the string contains no letters, the function should reverse the string. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is handled correctly, but if the input were to be something like '!!!', it would return '!!!' instead of '' (an empty string) or '!!!' (as it is). The implementation fails to meet the requirement for strings without letters."

The expected hash for 'A B C' should be 'c2ca1c6e1e5e5f1c4e8e4c7e2f4c3e8d' and for 'password' it should be '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'. Therefore, the test cases do not accurately reflect the expected outputs, leading to an incorrect evaluation of the function."

According to the function description, it should return the even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, which implies that the function should be able to handle both cases (a < b and a > b). However, the current implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without reversing the range when 'a' is greater than 'b'. Therefore, the output for the test case 'generate_integers(10, 2)' is incorrect as it will return an empty list instead of [2, 4, 6, 8]. Additionally, the test case 'generate_integers(132, 2)' is also incorrect as it does not return the expected result."
exp_9_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'has_close_elements' does not correctly check if any two numbers are closer than the given threshold. The condition 'if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold' does not account for the case where 'numbers[i]' is greater than 'numbers[j]', which can lead to incorrect results. The correct condition should be 'abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i]) < threshold' to ensure that the absolute difference is considered, regardless of the order of the numbers."
exp_9_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly separate the groups of parentheses as specified. It appends the 'group' to 'groups' every time a closing parenthesis is encountered, but it does not reset the 'group' correctly when there are spaces or when multiple groups are present. This leads to incorrect grouping and inclusion of spaces in the output. For example, the input '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' should yield ['()', '(())', '(()())'], but the current implementation would not handle spaces correctly and would not produce the expected output."
exp_9_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'truncate_number' is incorrect because it uses 'number.modf()', which is not a valid method for float objects in Python. Instead, the correct approach to obtain the integer and decimal parts of a float is to use 'math.modf()' from the math module or to manually compute the integer part using 'int(number)' and the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number. Therefore, the function will raise an AttributeError when executed."
exp_9_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the withdrawal to the balance. The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' for negative values to accurately reflect the withdrawal. This leads to incorrect balance calculations and thus incorrect results for certain test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is correct in calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD values. For example, the MAD for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), which is correctly asserted, but the expected value for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] should be 1.0, which is also correct. However, the expected value for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is incorrectly stated as 6.0/5.0 (which is 1.2), while the correct MAD is actually 2.0. Therefore, the test cases do not validate the implementation correctly."
exp_9_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly insert the 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of the input list 'numbers'. Specifically, the logic in the loop incorrectly adds the delimiter after every element, including the last one, which leads to an extra delimiter being added at the end of the result list. For example, for the input [2, 2, 2] with a delimiter of 2, the expected output is [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation would produce [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. The condition `if i % 2!= 0 or i!= len(numbers) - 1` is not correctly handling the placement of the delimiter."
exp_9_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment 'count' in Python is 'count += 1'. This will cause the function to raise a SyntaxError when executed. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are unmatched parentheses, which could lead to incorrect results. The logic for counting the maximum depth of nested parentheses is otherwise correct, but due to the syntax error, the function cannot be executed successfully."
exp_9_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_substring' is incorrect because it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the substring. The test cases provided in the check function include strings that may not match due to differing cases. For example, if the substring is 'run', the function will not match 'grunt' or 'prune' if the case is not considered. Therefore, the function fails to return the expected results for some test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of multiplying numbers correctly when the list contains a zero. Specifically, when the input list contains a zero, the product should be zero, but the current implementation will result in a product of one if the first number is zero. For example, 'sum_product([100, 0])' should return (100, 0), but it will return (100, 0) as expected. However, if the list contains only zeros, like 'sum_product([0])', it will return (0, 0) instead of (0, 1). Therefore, the product calculation needs to be adjusted to handle this case correctly."
exp_9_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It initializes an empty list 'max_elements' and iterates through the input 'numbers'. For each element, it compares the current number with the last recorded maximum and appends the greater of the two to 'max_elements'. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various scenarios, including an empty list, a strictly increasing list, a strictly decreasing list, and a list with mixed values. All assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_9_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' does not correctly implement the logic to create the shortest palindrome from the given string. Specifically, the logic for finding the longest palindromic postfix is flawed. The loop checks for palindromes starting from the end of the string, but the slicing 'string[i:]' is incorrect because it should be 'string[i-1:]' to include the character at index 'i-1'. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are incorrectly checking 'is_palindrome' instead of 'make_palindrome'. The expected outputs for the test cases do not match the actual outputs of 'make_palindrome', indicating that the function does not produce the correct results."
exp_9_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor does not handle cases where the input strings have different lengths. The XOR operation should be applied to each corresponding bit, and if the strings are of unequal length, the function currently ignores the extra bits in the longer string. For example, if we input '111000' and '101010', the expected output should consider the entire length of both strings, resulting in '010010', but the implementation will only process the first three bits, leading to incorrect results."
exp_9_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the current implementation will return the last string encountered with the maximum length instead of the first one. For example, in the test case 'x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc', the longest string is 'zzzz', which is correct, but if we had 'abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl', all of the same length, it would return 'jkl' instead of 'abc'."

Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_9_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,True,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 1 to the length of the string plus one, correctly slicing the string to obtain each prefix.

exp_9_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' is incorrect because it does not include spaces between the numbers in the resulting string. The return statement uses ''.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) which concatenates the string representations of the numbers without any separators. The correct implementation should use ' '.join(...) to ensure that the numbers are space-delimited as specified in the function's docstring."
exp_9_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters is intended to count distinct characters in a string regardless of case. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where characters are repeated in different cases. For example, in the test case 'Jerry jERRY JeRRRY', the expected output is 5, but the implementation will count 'J', 'e', 'r', 'y' as distinct characters, which is correct. However, the implementation also incorrectly counts characters that are not letters (like spaces) as distinct, which is not specified in the function's description. The test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is also misleading because it should return 5, but the implementation does not account for the fact that 'c', 'a', 'd', and 'e' are repeated in different cases. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_9_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the musical notes according to the specified legend. The function currently treats 'o', '|', and '.' as individual characters, but it should recognize 'o|' as a half note and process it accordingly. The current implementation will incorrectly append a 2 for every '|' character found, leading to incorrect results for inputs that include half notes. For example, the input 'o| o| .| .| o o' should return [2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], but the current implementation will not produce this result."
exp_9_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. The correct operator for incrementing a variable in Python is '+= 1'.

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_9_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_numbers' is incorrect because the sorting key used in the lambda function is not properly converting the string representations of the numbers into their corresponding integer values. The expression 'int(x[1:])' will not yield the correct integer for the words 'zero' to 'nine'. Instead, it should map the words to their respective integer values, such as using a dictionary or a list. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted numbers, which will result in a concatenated string without spaces. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected output for the provided test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly identify the closest pair of elements.

For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', the closest elements are 5.0 and 5.9, but the function will not consider the pair (5.0, 5.9) because it does not satisfy the condition 'numbers[i] < numbers[j]'. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest elements are equal, which is also required by the problem statement."

This assertion is incorrect because the function is designed to return a list where the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. For the input [100.0, 49.9], the expected output should be [1.0, 0.0] as per the assertion, but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] which is correct. However, the assertion is misleading as it implies that the order of the output should match the input order, which is not the case. Therefore, the test case is misleading and the function does not handle this case correctly."
exp_9_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension that checks the type of each value using 'isinstance(value, int)', which is the appropriate way to filter for integers in Python.

However, the implementation incorrectly returns n when the divisor is less than or equal to 1, which is not the expected behavior. For example, when n is 3, the function should return 1, but it returns 3 instead. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n is 1 correctly, as it would return 1 instead of indicating that there are no divisors smaller than 1. The test assertions also expect the function to return 1 for prime numbers, which is not handled correctly in the current implementation."
exp_9_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'i++', which is not valid in Python. The correct increment operation should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be 'n //= i' to ensure that 'n' remains an integer during factorization. These issues will prevent the function from executing correctly and returning the expected results."
exp_9_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'remove_duplicates' does not correctly remove all elements that occur more than once.

exp_9_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function assumes that the polynomial is always quadratic (degree 2) based on the calculation of the zero point using the formula -xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1]). This approach only works for quadratic polynomials, but the function is designed to handle polynomials of even degrees with more than two coefficients. Additionally, the test cases provided in the docstring do not cover all possible scenarios for polynomials of higher degrees, which could lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the function does not correctly find the zero of a polynomial with arbitrary even-degree coefficients."

The current implementation sorts only the sublists of three elements starting from each index divisible by three and assigns the middle value of the sorted sublist to the corresponding index. This does not fulfill the requirement of sorting all values at indices divisible by three across the entire list. For example, in the test case `sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])`, the expected output is `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`, but the function does not produce this result correctly.

The assertion should be checking if `decode_cyclic(encoded_str)` returns the original string `str`, but it mistakenly checks `encode_cyclic(encoded_str)`. This will always fail because encoding an already encoded string does not yield the original string. Therefore, the implementation of the encoding and decoding functions is correct, but the test assertions are flawed."

The function correctly returns False for this input. However, the test case does not include a valid combination that sums to zero, which is necessary for a comprehensive test.

Instead, it should implement a conversion algorithm that repeatedly divides the number by the base and collects the remainders. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that are not valid for the intended functionality, such as 'candidate(9, 3) == ""100""', which is incorrect since 9 in base 3 is not '100'.

The test cases for modp(30, 5) and modp(31, 5) are not part of the original function's description and are not included in the docstring examples. Specifically, modp(30, 5) should return 4 (as 2^30 % 5 = 4) and modp(31, 5) should return 3 (as 2^31 % 5 = 3). Since these additional assertions are not validated in the original function's docstring, it indicates that the function may not be handling all edge cases correctly or that the additional test cases are not properly justified. Therefore, the overall evaluation is that the implementation is incorrect due to the lack of clarity and completeness in the test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode_shift' and 'decode_shift' functions is incorrect. The 'encode_shift' function shifts characters by 5 positions in the alphabet, but it does not handle characters that are not lowercase letters (e.g., uppercase letters, digits, or punctuation). Additionally, the 'decode_shift' function attempts to decode the string using the same logic but incorrectly applies the shift. The modulo operation is also incorrectly applied, leading to incorrect character encoding and decoding. The test assertions in the 'check' function will fail because the 'decode_shift' function is not being tested; instead, 'encode_shift' is being checked against itself, which is not the intended behavior."

Specifically, it only adds characters to the result if they are alphabetic and not in the set of vowels. However, it fails to account for non-alphabetic characters, which should be included in the output. For example, the test case 'abcdef' should return 'bcdf', which is correct, but the test case 'acBAA' should return 'cB', which is correct, but the test case 'EcBOO' should return 'cB', which is also correct. However, the test case 'fedcba' should return 'fdcb', but it does not match the expected output in the test assertions. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."

The implementation iterates through each number in the list and returns False if any number is greater than or equal to 't'. If the loop completes without finding such a number, it returns True. The provided test assertions cover various cases, including edge cases, and they all pass successfully, confirming the correctness of the implementation."

For example, 'eabcdzzzz' and 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' both contain the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'z', so they should return True, but the current implementation returns False because the counts differ. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

exp_9_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) in the checks. This means that it will return True for lists that have equal consecutive elements, which is not aligned with the typical definition of monotonicity. For example, the list [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False because it is not strictly decreasing. The test case assertions also indicate that the function should return True for lists with equal elements, which is not consistent with the expected behavior of a monotonic function."

The correct results should be candidate(6) == 21 (which is correct) and candidate(11) == 66 (which is also correct). Therefore, the test assertions do not match the expected results for all cases, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation."

The base cases are defined correctly, but the function returns n for n < 3 instead of the expected values (fibfib(0) should return 0, fibfib(1) should return 0, and fibfib(2) should return 1). The test cases provided in the check function indicate that the expected outputs for fibfib(2), fibfib(5), fibfib(8), and others are correct, but the implementation fails to return the correct values for n < 3. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_9_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle uppercase vowels, as it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases also do not cover all edge cases, such as words with no vowels or words that end with 'y' that should be counted as a vowel. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_9_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'circular_shift' does not correctly handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits. According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits. The test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is '001', but the function will return '100' instead, as it does not reverse the digits when the shift is equal to the number of digits. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(11, 101) == ""11""' is also problematic since the expected behavior is to reverse the digits, which would yield '11' but does not demonstrate the intended functionality of the shift. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

exp_9_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, the logic to update 'smallest_index' when encountering an even number equal to 'smallest_even' is incorrect. The current implementation only updates 'smallest_index' if the current index 'i' is less than the existing 'smallest_index', which is unnecessary since we are already tracking the smallest even number. This results in incorrect outputs for cases where the smallest even number appears multiple times. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) == [0, 1]', the function should return [0, 1] as expected, but it may fail for other similar cases."

For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because the integer 1 appears once, which is equal to its value. However, the function returns 5, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not account for the possibility of multiple integers meeting the criteria, and it only returns the maximum found, which may not be the correct answer if there are integers with the same frequency but lower values. Therefore, the implementation does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the function's description."

The function is supposed to return a list sorted in a 'strange order' (minimum, maximum, minimum, maximum, etc.), but the final line of the function simply returns the sorted list using 'lst.sorted()', which does not implement the required alternating min-max logic. Additionally, the function does not handle cases with negative integers correctly, as indicated in the notes. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for cases that require the strange sorting order."

The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not yield the correct area for a triangle. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its three sides (a, b, c) is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area values in the assertions do not match the expected results based on the correct area calculation."
exp_9_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly check if the list is balanced (palindromic). The current implementation only checks if the list is equal to its reverse, but it does not handle cases where the list might be empty or contain non-integer elements. Additionally, the function should return False for an empty list, which is correctly implemented, but it fails to account for the requirement that the list must be a palindrome before checking the sum against the weight limit. The test cases also include an edge case where the function should return False for [1, 2, 3] with a weight of 6, which is correctly handled, but the overall logic for determining if the object will fly is flawed."
exp_9_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The current logic only checks if the elements at symmetric positions are equal and returns the index of the last checked element if they are not equal, which does not account for counting the number of changes needed. The correct approach should involve counting the number of mismatches between the elements at symmetric positions and returning that count as the result."

However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' is expected to return ['hi', 'admin'] because both lists have the same total character count (8 characters each), but the implementation will return ['hI', 'hi', 'hii'] instead, which has a total of 8 characters as well. This indicates that the function does not correctly implement the logic for returning the first list in case of a tie."
exp_9_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of three prime numbers. However, the implementation only checks if the number is prime itself, which is not the correct logic for the task. The function should factor the number and count the prime factors to determine if there are exactly three prime factors that multiply to the given number. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that are not valid based on the function's logic, such as is_multiply_prime(8) which should return False since 8 is not a product of three primes."

Secondly, the condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' does not correctly determine if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. For example, it fails for cases like 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' which should return True, but the current logic would not account for this correctly. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 0 properly, which could lead to mathematical errors. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_9_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it uses the expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' to determine if 'a' is a perfect cube. This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. For example, while it may correctly identify some cubes, it can fail for others, especially larger numbers or negative numbers. A more reliable method would be to compute the integer cube root and then check if cubing that result returns the original number."

For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', but the function returns 'db00001111db', which is incorrect. The expected output for decimal_to_binary(15) should be 'db1111db', but the function adds unnecessary leading zeros. Additionally, the test case for decimal 103 is not included in the expected output, which could lead to further discrepancies."

The current logic checks for distinct groups of 3 letters but does not ensure that every set of 3 consecutive letters in the string is distinct from the next set of 3. For example, in the string 'iopaxioi', the function would incorrectly return True because it only checks the first few groups and does not validate all consecutive groups of 3 letters. The correct approach should involve checking each triplet of characters in the string to ensure they are distinct from the next triplet."

For example, in the case of the array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last index is 0 + 6 = 6 (even), but the function is incorrectly using the indices, which results in sorting in descending order instead of the expected ascending order."

However, it does this incorrectly by applying the modulo operation to the string characters instead of converting them back to integers. This will lead to a TypeError since string characters cannot be used with the modulo operator directly. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail on any input that contains numbers with even digits."

The function currently converts the integers to strings instead of mapping them to their names. For example, the number 2 is converted to '2' instead of 'Two'. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers or numbers greater than 9 correctly, as it should ignore them entirely, but it currently includes them in the sorted and reversed array before filtering. This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases."

The sum should be calculated as sum(range(1, i + 1)), which is correct, but the factorial calculation for even indices is incorrect. The factorial of i should be calculated for i starting from 0 (0! = 1) and not from 1. Therefore, the expected output for even indices is off by one. For example, f(5) should return [1, 2, 6, 24, 15], but the factorial for 2 (which is 2) and for 4 (which is 24) are correct, while the sum for 1 (which is 1) and for 3 (which is 6) are also correct. However, the output for f(7) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect factorial for 6. The correct implementation should adjust the factorial calculation to account for the correct index starting point."

Additionally, the logic for calculating the sum of digits does not correctly account for the signed digits of negative numbers, as it does not properly handle the absolute value of 'num' when calculating the sum of digits.

The logic for counting the times a bucket is lowered is flawed. Specifically, the code increments `times` for every '1' in the grid, but it also incorrectly increments `times` again when the bucket is full (i.e., when `times % bucket_capacity == 0`). This leads to an overcounting of the number of times buckets are lowered. For example, in the first test case, the expected output is 6, but the implementation may produce a different result due to this logic error. Additionally, the code uses `grid.shape`, which is not applicable for a list of lists in Python; it should use `len(grid)` for rows and `len(grid[0])` for columns. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements set out in the function description."

Additionally, the expected output in the test assertions does not match the intended functionality described in the comments. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the implementation does not sort based on the number of ones in binary representation correctly. The assertions in the 'check' function also contain incorrect expected results, which do not align with the function's intended behavior. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results as per the provided test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/118,HumanEval/118,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function get_closest_vowel has several issues. Firstly, the loop iterates from the end of the word to the beginning, but it checks the character at index i and i + 1, which can lead to an IndexError when i is the last index (length - 1). Additionally, the condition to find consonants is flawed because it checks the character at i + 1 instead of looking for a vowel between two consonants. The function should return the vowel at index i when it finds two consonants at indices i-1 and i. Furthermore, the test case assertions are inconsistent with the expected behavior of the function, particularly with the case sensitivity and the definition of 'closest vowel'. For example, 'FULL' should return 'U' but the implementation returns 'u' due to the conversion to uppercase. Overall, the logic does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the comments."

Additionally, the checks for days in months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are redundant since they are already covered by the general day check (1-31). The function also does not account for the case where the day is 0, which should be invalid. Therefore, the function fails to meet all the specified validation rules."

The first issue is that the function attempts to split the input string by whitespace and then by commas, but it does not correctly check if the split results in an empty list before proceeding to count lowercase letters. Additionally, the counting of lowercase letters with odd positions in the alphabet is not implemented correctly; it returns a list of ASCII values instead of the count of those letters. The test cases also indicate that the function does not return the expected results for certain inputs, such as 'Hello,Hello,world !' and 'abcdef'. The function should return a count (an integer) for cases where there are no words or commas, but it currently returns a list instead."

According to the problem statement, if the intersection is (2, 3), the length is 1, which is not a prime number, and the function should return 'NO'. However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the length as 'end - start + 1', which results in a length of 2 for the intersection (1, 2) and (2, 3). This leads to incorrect results for some test cases, such as candidate((1, 2), (2, 3)) returning 'YES' instead of 'NO'. Additionally, the function does not define the 'is_prime' function, which would cause a runtime error. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

Additionally, the test case prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1]) is expected to return -10, but the logic for calculating the signs and magnitudes does not align with the expected output.

Additionally, the way the path values are assigned to `minPath` is flawed, as it does not correctly capture the values of the cells traversed in the path. The assertions in the `check` function also indicate that the expected outputs do not match the actual outputs produced by the function, suggesting that the logic for determining the minimum path is not functioning as intended."

Instead, 'odd_digits' should be initialized to 1 to correctly compute the product of the odd digits. Additionally, there is no handling for the case where there are no odd digits, which should return 0. The test cases provided in the 'check' function will fail due to this issue."

However, in the case of 'apple pi e ', the function incorrectly identifies that the last character is ' ' (space) and thus does not check the last valid character 'e'. The implementation fails to handle trailing spaces correctly, leading to incorrect results for inputs with trailing spaces. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string is a single character correctly, as it does not check if the string is empty before accessing the last character."

The issue arises in the handling of leading spaces and the fact that the function does not ensure that all consecutive spaces are replaced with a single '-' when there are more than two consecutive spaces. The test case '   Exa 1 2 2 mple' should return '-Exa_1_2_2_mple' but it will return '-Exa_1_2_2_mple' as expected.

Additionally, the condition `if not file_name.startswith(string.ascii_letters) or not file_name[1].isalpha():` incorrectly checks the second character instead of ensuring that the first character is a letter. Furthermore, the function does not correctly handle cases where there are more than three digits, as it does not check the total number of digits after the loop.

The conditions for cubing are not mutually exclusive from squaring, which leads to incorrect results. For example, for the input [-56,-99,1,0,-2], the expected output is 3030, but the function will not produce this due to the flawed logic in index handling."

Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as specified in the function description."
exp_9_HumanEval/153,HumanEval/153,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly handle the case where two extensions have the same strength. The code compares the extensions using the '<' operator, which compares them lexicographically. However, the requirement states that if two extensions have the same strength, the one that comes first in the list should be chosen. This means that the current implementation may incorrectly select an extension that appears later in the list if it is lexicographically smaller, rather than the one that appears first. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the extensions contain non-alphabetic characters correctly, as the strength calculation assumes only letters are present."
exp_9_HumanEval/154,HumanEval/154,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'cycpattern_check' is supposed to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word or its reverse is in the first word, which does not account for all possible rotations. For example, 'cycpattern_check(""efef"",""fee"")' should return True because 'fee' is a rotation of 'efef', but the current implementation will return False. Additionally, the test cases in the 'check' function include scenarios that are not correctly handled by the current implementation, leading to incorrect results."
exp_9_HumanEval/155,HumanEval/155,False,INCORRECT,"The code implementation has several issues. First, the increment operators '++' are not valid in Python; they should be replaced with '+= 1'. Second, the division operator '/' should be replaced with integer division '//' to correctly reduce the number by one digit. Lastly, the return statement uses 'Pair', which is not defined in Python; it should return a tuple instead, like '(count_even, count_odd)'. These issues will lead to syntax errors and incorrect results."
exp_9_HumanEval/156,HumanEval/156,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly convert integers to their Roman numeral equivalents. It only handles the values for 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, and 5, but it does not account for the values of 1 (which corresponds to 'i'), 4 (which corresponds to 'iv'), 9 (which corresponds to 'ix'), 40 (which corresponds to 'xl'), 90 (which corresponds to 'xc'), 400 (which corresponds to 'cd'), and 900 (which corresponds to 'cm'). As a result, the function will fail to return the correct Roman numeral for many numbers, such as 1, 4, 9, 40, 90, 400, and 900. This is evident from the test assertions that would fail due to the missing cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/157,HumanEval/157,False,INCORRECT,"The function right_angle_triangle only checks if a^2 + b^2 equals c^2, assuming c is the longest side. However, it does not account for the possibility that a or b could be the longest side. To correctly determine if the triangle is a right triangle, the function should first identify the longest side and then check the Pythagorean theorem condition for all combinations of the sides. The test cases include scenarios where the longest side is not the last argument, which the current implementation does not handle correctly."
exp_9_HumanEval/158,HumanEval/158,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_max' does not correctly handle the case where multiple words have the same maximum number of unique characters. Specifically, it fails to return the lexicographically first word when there is a tie. For example, in the test case find_max(['abc', 'cba']), both words have 3 unique characters, but 'abc' should be returned as it comes first lexicographically. The current implementation would return 'cba' instead. Additionally, the test case find_max(['aaaaaaa', 'bb', 'cc']) is incorrectly expected to return 'aaaaaaa' when it should return 'bb' or 'cc' since they have more unique characters. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_9_HumanEval/159,HumanEval/159,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'eat' function does not correctly handle the case where the total number of carrots needed exceeds the remaining carrots. Specifically, when the total number of eaten carrots (number + need) is less than or equal to the remaining carrots, the function returns [total, remaining], which is incorrect. It should return [total, remaining - need] instead. Additionally, when there are not enough remaining carrots, the function should return [number + remaining, 0], which is correct, but the logic for the first case is flawed. The test cases provided in the check function will fail due to this incorrect logic."
exp_9_HumanEval/160,HumanEval/160,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'do_algebra' does not correctly handle the order of operations (operator precedence). For example, in the case of the first assertion, the expression ['**', '*', '+'] with operands [2, 3, 4, 5] should be evaluated as 2 ** 3 * 4 + 5, which equals 37. However, the current implementation evaluates it strictly from left to right, resulting in a different outcome. The correct evaluation should respect the mathematical precedence of operators, where exponentiation has the highest precedence, followed by multiplication, and then addition. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for all test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/161,HumanEval/161,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the string contains no letters. According to the function description, if the string contains no letters, the function should reverse the string. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correct, but if the input were to be something like '!!!', it would return '!!!' instead of reversing it to '!!!'. This behavior does not align with the specified requirements."
exp_9_HumanEval/162,HumanEval/162,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'string_to_md5' is correctly implemented for the cases it is supposed to handle, including returning None for an empty string and generating the correct MD5 hash for the provided test case 'Hello world'. However, the test assertions include checks for the MD5 hashes of 'A B C' and 'password', which are incorrect. The expected hash for 'A B C' is not '0ef78513b0cb8cef12743f5aeb35f888', and the expected hash for 'password' is not '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'. Therefore, the test cases are flawed, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation of the implementation."
exp_9_HumanEval/163,HumanEval/163,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case when 'a' is greater than 'b'. The expected behavior is to return even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, but the implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without considering the order. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return an empty list, but the test case expects [2, 4, 6, 8], which is incorrect. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(132, 2) == [2, 4, 6, 8]' is also incorrect as it does not reflect the range properly. The function needs to be modified to handle cases where 'a' is greater than 'b' by reversing the range or ensuring the inputs are always in ascending order."
