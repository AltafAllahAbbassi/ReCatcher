exp_0_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'has_close_elements' has a logical error in the nested loop. The inner loop should iterate from 'i + 1' to 'len(numbers)', but it currently checks all indices from 'i + 1' to 'len(numbers) - 1'. This means that the last element is not being compared with the current element 'i', which can lead to missing pairs that are closer than the threshold. For example, in the test case 'has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3)', the function may return incorrect results due to this oversight."
exp_0_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'separate_paren_groups' is not implemented, as indicated by the 'TODO' comment. Therefore, it cannot correctly separate groups of nested parentheses as described in the function's docstring. Without a proper implementation, it will not pass the provided test assertions."
exp_0_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,CORRECT,"The function 'truncate_number' correctly calculates the decimal part of a positive floating point number by subtracting the largest integer smaller than the number (using 'math.floor') from the number itself. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct decimal parts for the given inputs."
exp_0_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly implements the logic to track the balance of a bank account starting from zero. It iterates through the list of operations, updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns True, which matches the requirements stated in the function's docstring. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness, as all assertions pass without errors."
exp_0_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is incorrect because it uses 'mean(numbers)' without importing or defining the 'mean' function. Additionally, the test assertions are not correctly validating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for the provided datasets. The expected results in the assertions do not match the correct MAD calculations. For example, the MAD for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3, but the assertion checks for a different value. The function needs to be corrected to properly calculate the mean and then compute the MAD based on that mean."
exp_0_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly handle the case where the input list has more than one element. Specifically, it adds a delimiter after the first element but does not correctly intersperse it between all elements. For example, the call intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2) should return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation will not produce this result. The recursive call does not properly concatenate the delimiter between all elements."
exp_0_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. The use of 'max(len(re.findall(r'\(', x))' only counts the number of opening parentheses in each group, rather than determining the maximum depth of nesting. For example, for the input '(()())', it would return 2, which is correct, but for '((()))', it would also return 2 instead of 3. The correct approach would involve tracking the current depth while iterating through the characters of each group and updating the maximum depth accordingly."
exp_0_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_substring is intended to filter strings that contain the specified substring. However, the test case 'check(candidate)' includes an assertion that expects 'grunt' and 'prune' to be returned when filtering with the substring 'run'. Neither 'grunt' nor 'prune' contains the substring 'run', which makes this assertion incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The use of 'reduce' from the 'functools' module is missing an import statement, and it will raise a NameError. Additionally, the product of an empty list should return 1, but the current implementation will return 0 if the list is empty, which is incorrect. The test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)' is also misleading, as the product of 100 and 0 should be 0, which is correctly handled, but the overall logic is flawed."
exp_0_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It iterates through the list and appends the maximum value found from the start of the list up to the current index. The provided test cases in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected, returning the correct rolling maximum for various input scenarios."
exp_0_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is incorrectly implemented. The test assertions provided in the 'check' function are meant for the 'is_palindrome' function, not for 'make_palindrome'. Additionally, the logic in 'make_palindrome' does not correctly construct the shortest palindrome for all cases. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate('jerry') == 'jerryrrej'' is incorrect; the expected output should be 'jerryj' instead. The function fails to handle cases where the input string is not a palindrome correctly."
exp_0_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. The test case candidate('111000', '101010') fails because the function will only iterate over the length of the shorter string, resulting in an incorrect output. The expected output for this case should be '010010', but the function will only process the first three characters of each string, leading to an incorrect result."
exp_0_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'longest' is supposed to return the first longest string in case of ties, but it uses the 'max' function which returns the last longest string instead. For example, in the test case 'check(candidate(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])', the expected output is 'zzzz', but if there were another string of the same length as 'zzzz' before it, 'max' would return that one instead of 'zzzz'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirement of returning the first longest string in case of ties."
exp_0_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they cover various scenarios and return the expected results. The function handles both cases of coprime numbers and numbers with common factors accurately."
exp_0_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,True,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates a list of all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 1 to the length of the string plus one, slicing the string appropriately to obtain each prefix. The provided test assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various input cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_0_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The function string_sequence is supposed to return a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to n inclusive. However, the implementation uses ''.join() without a space delimiter, which results in the numbers being concatenated without spaces. For example, string_sequence(5) would return '012345' instead of '0 1 2 3 4 5'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly counts distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The implementation uses a set to store unique characters after converting the string to lowercase, which aligns with the function's description. The provided test assertions validate various cases, including empty strings, strings with all distinct characters, and strings with repeated characters, all of which return the expected results."
exp_0_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical note legend. Instead of returning a list of integers based on the input string, it returns a hardcoded list. The function fails to account for the different note representations ('o', 'o|', and '.|') and their corresponding beat values. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will not pass, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring. The current approach calculates the difference in length between the original string and the string after removing all occurrences of the substring. This method fails to account for overlapping cases, such as in the example of 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', where the expected count is 3 (the overlaps 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the implementation would return 2. A correct implementation would involve iterating through the string and checking for the substring at each index, allowing for overlaps."
exp_0_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sorting is done lexicographically (alphabetically) rather than numerically. For example, 'three five nine' should return 'three five nine' as it is already sorted, but the expected output should be 'five three nine' if sorted numerically. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which causes the output to be concatenated without spaces. The correct implementation should map the words to their corresponding numeric values, sort those values, and then convert them back to words before returning."
exp_0_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly return the closest elements in all cases. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the closest elements are 2.2 and 2.0, which have a difference of 0.2, while 3.9 and 4.0 have a difference of 0.1. The function should return (2.0, 2.2) instead of (3.9, 4.0). This indicates that the logic for finding the closest elements is flawed."
exp_0_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'rescale_to_unit' does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum values are the same, which would lead to a division by zero in the expression '(max_val - min_val)'. This situation can occur if the input list contains identical elements. The test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is also incorrect because it expects the output to be in the range [0.0, 1.0] but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] instead, which is not a valid rescaling. Therefore, the implementation is not correct."
exp_0_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various input cases, including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass, indicating that the function works correctly."
exp_0_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strlen' correctly returns the length of the given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function also validate the correctness of the implementation by testing various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_0_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' is intended to find the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n' itself. However, the implementation starts the loop from 'n' and checks for divisibility, returning 'n' if it is divisible by itself, which is not the desired behavior. The correct implementation should start from 'n-1' and check downwards to find the largest divisor smaller than 'n'. For example, calling 'largest_divisor(3)' should return 1, but the current implementation would incorrectly return 3."
exp_0_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'factorize' function does not correctly factorize the input integer. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect results as it does not properly handle cases where a factor is repeated. For example, when testing with 70, the expected output is [2, 5, 7], but the function may not return this correctly due to the way it reduces n. Additionally, the function does not check for factors beyond the square root of n, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results for larger numbers. The test cases provided in the 'check' function may pass for some inputs but fail for others, indicating that the implementation is not robust."
exp_0_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'remove_duplicates' is not implemented, which means it does not perform any operations to remove duplicates from the input list. The provided test cases will fail because the function will return None instead of the expected output. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'swapcase()' is appropriate for this task, and the test assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, including an empty string and strings with punctuation."
exp_0_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The function 'concatenate' correctly implements the logic to join a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the expected behavior of 'concatenate' for both an empty list and a list with multiple strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings that start with the specified prefix. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']' is incorrect because the expected output should include all occurrences of strings that start with 'xxx', which are 'xxx', 'xxxAAA', and 'xxx'. The correct expected output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] but the assertion fails because it does not account for multiple occurrences of 'xxx'. Therefore, the test case does not validate the function correctly."
exp_0_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is intended to return only positive numbers from the input list. However, the test assertions in the check function reveal that the expected output for the second test case is incorrect. The expected output should not include the zero (0) as it is not a positive number. The correct output for the second test case should be [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1], which matches the implementation. However, the first test case in the check function is incorrectly asserting that the output should include zero, which is not a positive number. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases are not accurately reflecting the requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for primality. The loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. It should only check up to the square root of n for factors. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for even numbers greater than 2 correctly, as it will incorrectly return True for even numbers other than 2. This can lead to incorrect results for larger numbers."
exp_0_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect because it does not properly handle the polynomial evaluation and root-finding process. Specifically, the function uses the 'poly' function incorrectly in the Newton-Raphson method. The formula for updating 'x' should involve the derivative of the polynomial, but the current implementation does not compute the derivative correctly. Additionally, the polynomial evaluation in 'poly' is incorrectly described in the comment; it should use 'xs[i] * x^i' instead of 'xs[1] * x^2' for the second term. This leads to incorrect results when finding roots, as the polynomial may not converge to the correct zero point."
exp_0_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it sorts the sublist of three elements starting from that index. This leads to incorrect results as seen in the test cases. For example, in the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the function will not produce this output because it sorts the first three elements [5, 6, 3] instead of just placing the sorted values at the correct indices."
exp_0_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to remove duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the resulting unique elements. The provided test assertion checks the function with a specific input and verifies that the output matches the expected result, which it does."
exp_0_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct, as it uses the built-in 'max' function to return the maximum element in the list. However, the test case in the 'check' function contains an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum element in that list is actually 124, not 123 as stated in the original docstring. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed."
exp_0_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the count of '7's in the string representation of the number is greater than 0, which means it increments the count for each number containing at least one '7'. The expected behavior is to count the total occurrences of the digit '7', not just whether it appears at least once. For example, the number 77 should contribute 2 to the count, but the current implementation would only count it as 1. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for the test cases provided."
exp_0_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the even indexed elements while preserving the odd indexed elements. The function collects even numbers and odd numbers separately, sorts the even numbers in descending order, and then appends the odd numbers to the end of the list. This approach does not maintain the original positions of the odd indexed elements in the output list. For example, in the test case 'sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])', the expected output is '[3, 6, 5, 4]', but the function would return '[6, 5, 3, 4]', which is incorrect. The function needs to sort only the elements at even indices and place them back in their respective positions in the final list."
exp_0_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic' correctly decodes the string encoded by 'encode_cyclic'. Additionally, the 'decode_cyclic' function is implemented correctly to reverse the encoding process, but it is not being tested. Therefore, the evaluation of correctness is based on the fact that the test is not appropriately validating the decoding function."
exp_0_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation only correctly handles the first two cases (n = 1 and n = 2) by returning 2 and 3, respectively. For n >= 3, it calls a function 'fibonacci(n)', which is not defined in the provided code. This will result in a NameError when n is greater than 2. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime; the function should instead generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is incomplete and always returns False, which does not fulfill the requirement of checking for three distinct elements that sum to zero. The provided test cases include scenarios where the function should return True, but due to the lack of implementation, it fails to do so. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified functionality."
exp_0_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it only contains a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any calculations or return any values. The test assertions expect the function to return the number of collisions, which is calculated as n * n (since each car moving left to right can collide with each car moving right to left). Without an implementation, the function cannot pass the tests."
exp_0_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is implemented correctly and returns the expected output for the provided test cases. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an incorrect expected output for the input [3, 2, 1]. The expected output should be [4, 3, 2] but the function actually returns [4, 3, 2], which is correct. The assertion for the input [5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123] is also incorrect as the expected output is [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124] but the correct output should be [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]. Therefore, the overall evaluation is incorrect due to the faulty assertions."
exp_0_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is not implemented, which means it does not contain any logic to check for pairs of integers that sum to zero. As a result, it cannot return the expected outputs for the provided test cases, leading to failures in the assertions. The function must be implemented correctly to evaluate pairs of distinct integers in the list."
exp_0_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'change_base' is incorrect because it does not handle the conversion of numbers correctly for all bases. Specifically, the test case 'change_base(9, 3)' is expected to return '100', but the function will raise an error because the expected output for 9 in base 3 is actually '1000'. Additionally, the test case 'change_base(234, 2)' is expected to return '11101010', which is correct, but the function does not validate the output for all bases correctly. The assertion 'assert candidate(x, x + 1) == str(x)' is also problematic because it assumes that the output will match the string representation of the input number, which is not the case for bases greater than 10. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/45,HumanEval/45,True,CORRECT,"The function 'triangle_area' correctly implements the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base * height) / 2. The provided test assertions confirm that the function returns the expected results for the given inputs, including the example in the docstring. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the implementation is functioning as intended."
exp_0_HumanEval/46,HumanEval/46,False,INCORRECT,"The provided code does not implement the fib4 function, which is supposed to compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence without using recursion. The test assertions provided in the check function indicate expected outputs for specific inputs, but since the fib4 function is not implemented, it cannot produce any output. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is incorrect because the expected output for the second test case in the check function is wrong. The median of the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] should be 10.0, not 8.0. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, which could lead to an error. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements as specified in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/48,HumanEval/48,True,CORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse.

Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_0_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp is intended to return 2^n modulo p. The provided test cases include assertions that are not satisfied by the implementation. Specifically, the assertions check for modp(30, 5) and modp(31, 5), which are not part of the original function's docstring examples. The expected results for these cases are incorrect based on the mathematical calculations of 2^30 % 5 and 2^31 % 5. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all test cases, indicating that it is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The encode_shift function is designed to shift characters by 5 positions in the alphabet, but it does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet ('a' to 'z'). Additionally, the decode_shift function is supposed to reverse the encoding, but it also does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet. The test assertions in the check function are incorrectly checking the encode_shift function instead of the decode_shift function, which should be tested to ensure it correctly decodes the output of encode_shift. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is not correctly handling uppercase vowels. The vowels string only contains lowercase vowels ('aeiou'), so uppercase vowels ('AEIOU') are not being removed from the input text.

exp_0_HumanEval/52,HumanEval/52,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'below_threshold' is intended to return True if all numbers in the list are below the threshold 't'. However, the implementation checks if any number is greater than 't' and returns False immediately if it finds one. This is correct. However, the test cases include assertions that are not valid based on the function's description. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([1, 20, 4, 10], 21)' is expected to return True, which is correct, but the assertion 'assert not candidate([1, 8, 4, 10], 10)' is incorrect because 10 is not below 10, so it should return False, which is correctly asserted. The function works as intended, but the test cases have inconsistencies regarding the expected outcomes."

exp_0_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, but it only checks if they have the same characters in the same frequency. The test cases provided in the docstring and the assertions in the 'check' function imply that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True because they both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', but the current implementation would return False due to differing frequencies. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described."

exp_0_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function is incorrect. The derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients should be calculated by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and reducing the power by one. The current implementation incorrectly uses 'len(xs) - i' which does not accurately represent the power of x for each coefficient. For example, the derivative of the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] should yield [1, 4, 12, 20], which is correct, but the implementation fails for other cases like [3, 2, 1, 0, 4] where it returns [2, 2, 0, 16] instead of the correct [2, 2, 0, 0]. Additionally, the case for a single coefficient [1] should return an empty list, which is correctly handled. However, the overall logic for calculating the derivative is flawed."

It handles the base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2 correctly, returning 0, 0, and 1 respectively. The recursive case correctly computes the n-th FibFib number by summing the results of the three preceding numbers in the sequence. The test assertions provided in the check function confirm that the implementation produces the expected results for various inputs, including those not explicitly mentioned in the docstring. Therefore, the implementation is both correct and efficient given the nature of the problem."
exp_0_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' does not correctly handle uppercase vowels and the condition for 'y' being a vowel only at the end of the word. For example, the input 'Alone' should return 3, but the function does not account for uppercase vowels. Additionally, the function counts 'y' as a vowel regardless of its position in the word, which contradicts the requirement that 'y' is only a vowel when it is at the end of the word. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'circular_shift' does not handle the case where the shift value is greater than the number of digits correctly. According to the function's description, if 'shift' is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is '001', but the actual output is '00' (the first two digits are shifted out and not included in the result). Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' fails because the shift is greater than the number of digits, and the expected output should be '79', but the function does not handle this correctly. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

exp_0_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'fruit_distribution' is designed to calculate the number of mangoes in a basket based on the number of apples and oranges provided in a string and the total number of fruits. However, the implementation incorrectly assumes that the string format will always be consistent (i.e., 'X apples and Y oranges'). If the string format varies or if there are more than two types of fruits, the function will fail. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion that expects the output to be 10 for the input '5 apples and 6 oranges' with a total of 21 fruits, which is incorrect based on the logic of the function (it should return 10). Therefore, the implementation does not handle all cases correctly."

exp_0_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly sort the list in the specified 'strange order'. The current implementation simply returns the first element followed by a recursive call on the rest of the list, which does not adhere to the requirement of alternating between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4] should yield [1, 4, 2, 3], but the current implementation does not produce this result. The function needs to be restructured to correctly alternate between the minimum and maximum values from the list."
exp_0_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (a * b * c) / (4 * (a + b + c)), does not yield the correct area for a triangle given its sides. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its sides a, b, and c is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the test case assertions include incorrect expected values, such as triangle_area(1, 1, 1) which should return approximately 0.43 but actually returns 0.43 based on the incorrect formula. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_0_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly implements the requirements specified in the comments. It checks if the list is empty and returns False, which is appropriate. It verifies if the list is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If it is balanced, it then checks if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight 'w'. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, and all assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_0_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' is overly complex and does not correctly handle all cases for arrays of length greater than 5. The logic for determining the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is not generalized and relies on hardcoded conditions for specific lengths. For example, it fails to correctly compute the number of changes for arrays of length 6 or more. Additionally, the function does not utilize a systematic approach to compare elements from the start and end of the array, which is essential for determining palindromic properties. A more efficient and correct approach would involve iterating through the first half of the array and comparing it to the corresponding elements from the end, counting mismatches to determine the number of changes required."

According to the function's description, if both lists have the same total number of characters, it should return the first list. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' fails because the total character count of both lists is the same (8 characters each), but the function will return the second list instead of the first one. This indicates that the implementation does not correctly handle the equality case."
exp_0_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime does not correctly determine if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as a product of two prime factors, which is insufficient. For example, the assertion candidate(8) == True is incorrect because 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, which is not a product of three distinct prime numbers. Additionally, the function lacks a proper check for the count of prime factors, which is essential to meet the requirement of being the multiplication of exactly three primes."
exp_0_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' does not correctly determine if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. The condition 'x == n ** int(x / n)' is flawed because it does not accurately check if there exists an integer 'k' such that 'n**k = x'. Instead, it incorrectly calculates 'k' based on 'x' and 'n', which can lead to incorrect results. For example, 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' should return True, but the current implementation will not handle this correctly. Additionally, the function does not account for cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 1, which can lead to further incorrect evaluations."
exp_0_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'iscube' is intended to determine if a given integer is a perfect cube. However, the current implementation checks if the cube root of 'a' is an integer by comparing 'a**(1/3)' to 'int(a**(1/3))'. This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for large integers. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the test case checks for '1728', which is a perfect cube. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly since the cube root of a negative number is also negative, and the comparison will not yield the expected results. A more reliable approach would be to compute the cube root, round it to the nearest integer, and then cube that integer to see if it equals 'a'."
exp_0_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'hex_key' is supposed to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string. However, the prime digits in hexadecimal are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), and D (13). The function correctly checks for these digits, but the test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is incorrect because the input should be a string, not a list. An empty string should return 0, but passing an empty list will raise a TypeError. Therefore, the implementation does not handle the edge case correctly."

The condition 'if s[i:i+3] == s[i+1:i+4]' only checks if the first two characters of the 3-character substring are the same, which does not ensure that all three characters are distinct. For example, the input 'abc' would incorrectly return True, but it should return True because all characters are distinct. The correct approach would be to check if all three characters are different, which can be done by checking if the set of the substring has a length of 3."
exp_0_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values that are strictly less than the thresholds for letter grades. For example, the GPA of 3.0 should yield 'B+', but the implementation incorrectly assigns 'B+' to any GPA that is 3.0 or greater. The same issue occurs for other thresholds as well. The correct implementation should use '>' for all comparisons except for the highest grade (A+), which should be '>=', and the lowest grade (E), which should be '=='. This leads to incorrect letter grades being assigned for certain GPA values."
exp_0_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prime_length' contains a logical error in determining whether the length of the string is a prime number. Specifically, the function incorrectly returns True for strings of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the loop that checks for factors of the string length does not correctly handle the case where the length is 2, as it will return True for all lengths greater than 1 that are not divisible by any number from 2 to len(string)-1. This leads to incorrect results for strings of lengths that are not prime. For example, 'orange' has a length of 6, which is not prime, but the function would incorrectly return True for it. Therefore, the assertions in the test cases will fail for certain inputs."
exp_0_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' is inefficient and incorrect for counting n-digit integers that start or end with 1. The current implementation iterates through all n-digit integers, which is computationally expensive for larger n. Additionally, it does not account for the overlap of numbers that both start and end with 1, leading to potential overcounting. The correct approach should calculate the counts mathematically: for n-digit numbers, there are 10^(n-1) total numbers, and the counts of those starting with 1 and ending with 1 can be derived without iteration."
exp_0_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer N, but it instead returns the binary representation of N itself. For example, for N = 1000, the sum of digits is 1, but the function returns '1111101000', which is the binary representation of 1000. The test assertions expect the binary representation of the sum of the digits, not the number itself, leading to incorrect results."
exp_0_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is intended to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the implementation incorrectly sums the elements at even indices instead, as it uses 'range(0, len(lst), 2)', which starts from index 0 and increments by 2. This results in summing elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc., rather than the odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.). Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement as described in the docstring."
exp_0_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `anti_shuffle` does not correctly sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces. The current implementation uses `sorted(s.split())`, which sorts the list of words instead of sorting the characters within each word. As a result, the output does not match the expected behavior described in the comments. For example, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation does not achieve this."
exp_0_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'get_row' does not correctly handle the case where the integer 'x' appears multiple times in the same row. The method 'index()' returns the first occurrence of 'x', which means that if 'x' appears multiple times in a row, only the first occurrence's coordinates will be recorded. This leads to incorrect results for cases where 'x' appears more than once in the same row. For example, in the test case with the input 'get_row([[1, 2, 1, 4], [1, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], 1)', the expected output should include all occurrences of '1', but the current implementation will only capture the first occurrence in each row."
exp_0_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' is incorrect because it does not sort the array as specified in the function's description. The function is supposed to sort the array in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, and in descending order if the sum is even. However, the implementation only checks the length of the array and does not perform any sorting. For example, it returns the original array for lengths greater than 2 without sorting, which violates the requirement to return a sorted copy of the array. Additionally, the function does not handle arrays longer than 20 elements correctly, as it is incomplete and cuts off abruptly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encrypt' function is incorrect because it does not properly rotate the alphabet by two positions as described in the function's docstring. The code attempts to create a new alphabet by shifting the original alphabet, but it then unnecessarily duplicates and replaces characters in a way that does not yield the expected results. The test cases provided in the 'check' function will fail because the output of 'encrypt' does not match the expected encrypted strings. For example, 'hi' should return 'jk', not 'lm', and other test cases will also produce incorrect results."
exp_0_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is not unique. For example, in the test case next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected output is None since there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -35 as the second smallest, but the function will return -34 after sorting, which is incorrect. The implementation fails to check for duplicates properly."
exp_0_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' does not correctly count the number of sentences that start with the word 'I'. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the letter 'I' in the string, which does not take into account sentence delimiters or the position of 'I' at the beginning of sentences. For example, the input 'I love It !' incorrectly returns 1 instead of 1, but 'I feel good today. I will be productive. will kill It' incorrectly returns 2 instead of 1, as only the first sentence starts with 'I'. The function needs to split the input string into sentences and check the first word of each sentence."
exp_0_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' does not correctly check if all inputs are integers before evaluating the condition. The current implementation only checks if 'x' is equal to the sum of 'y' and 'z' and whether 'x' is an integer. It fails to check if 'y' and 'z' are also integers before returning True. This leads to incorrect results for cases where 'y' or 'z' are not integers, even if 'x' is equal to their sum. For example, 'any_int(3.0, 4, 7)' should return False, but it incorrectly returns True because '3.0' is treated as an integer.

exp_0_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly swap the case of letters or replace vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet. Specifically, it only converts the input message to lowercase and does not handle uppercase letters or the vowel replacement correctly. For example, the input 'TEST' should return 'tgst', but the current implementation would return 'tgs' instead. Additionally, the vowel replacement logic is flawed as it directly accesses the character two positions ahead without considering the vowel itself. The test cases provided in the 'check' function will fail due to these issues."

Instead, the function should check if all keys are either all upper case or all lower case. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the dictionary is empty correctly, as it should return False, which it does. However, the overall logic for checking the case of the keys is flawed."

Additionally, the function is hardcoded for specific values of n, making it inefficient and unable to handle larger inputs dynamically. The implementation fails to generate the correct list of primes for values greater than 23, as it is truncated at the end. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

However, the expected results in the test cases do not match the actual implementation. For example, multiply(19, 28) should return 72, but the unit digits are 9 and 8, which multiply to 72, so that part is correct. However, for multiply(148, 412), the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16, which is also correct. The issue arises with the test case multiply(14, -15) which should return 20, but the unit digits are 4 and 5, which multiply to 20, so that is also correct. The test case multiply(76, 67) should return 42, but the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42, so that is correct as well. The function is correct for the provided test cases, but the expected output for the test cases is not consistent with the function's purpose. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect based on the expected outputs in the test cases."

However, the test case count_upper('EEEE') is expected to return 2, but it actually returns 1 because the function only checks the characters at indices 0 and 2 (both 'E'), which are uppercase vowels. The implementation is correct in counting uppercase vowels at even indices, but the expected output for the test case is incorrect. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the code is incorrect due to the mismatch in expected results."
exp_0_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function closest_integer does not correctly handle the rounding away from zero for equidistant values.

The logic for determining the largest even number in the range is flawed, as it does not account for the scenario where x is less than y and both numbers are odd or even.

Additionally, the conversion of integers to their corresponding names is not done correctly, as the code attempts to convert all elements to strings multiple times without filtering them first. The correct approach should involve filtering the array for valid integers (1-9), sorting that filtered array, reversing it, and then mapping those integers to their string representations.

For example, for the input '1234567', the correct count of odd digits is 4 (1, 3, 5, 7), but the implementation incorrectly counts it as 4 by subtracting the count of '0's from the length of the string. This leads to incorrect outputs for the test cases provided."

For example, in the test case candidate([-1, -2, -3, 2, -10]), the correct minimum sub-array sum is -14, but the implementation would not capture this correctly due to the reset condition. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input array is empty correctly, as it returns 0 instead of raising an error or returning None, which is not specified in the function's description."

However, the test assertions include negative integers, which contradicts the function's description that specifies only non-negative integers should be sorted. Additionally, the expected outputs in the assertions do not match the expected behavior of the function based on its description. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([1,5,2,3,4]) == [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]' is incorrect as the expected output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The test cases provided will fail because the function does not adhere to the specified behavior of counting consonants."
exp_0_HumanEval/118,HumanEval/118,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function get_closest_vowel has several issues. Firstly, it converts the input word to lowercase, which causes it to lose case sensitivity as specified in the function description. This leads to incorrect results for words with uppercase vowels. For example, 'FULL' should return 'U', but it returns 'u' instead. Additionally, the logic for checking the closest vowel is flawed; it does not correctly identify vowels that are between two consonants. The function should iterate through the word and check for a vowel that is immediately preceded and followed by consonants, but it currently only checks the last vowel found. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Firstly, the date format is not consistently validated; it attempts to replace '-' with '/' but does not correctly handle the validation for the date format 'mm-dd-yyyy'. Additionally, the logic for checking the validity of days in each month is overly complicated and does not cover all edge cases, such as leap years for February. The function also does not properly handle cases where the month or day is not a two-digit number, which can lead to incorrect parsing. Furthermore, the function is incomplete and cuts off mid-logic, which would lead to runtime errors. Overall, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

This results in the function always splitting the input text by whitespace, regardless of whether there are commas or not. Additionally, the counting of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet is incorrectly implemented; it does not correctly count only those letters that are in odd positions. The test cases also reveal issues with the expected outputs, particularly with the handling of punctuation and whitespace."

Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1]) == -10' is incorrect; the expected output should be 10 instead of -10, as there are 6 positive numbers and 1 negative number, leading to a product of -1 and a sum of magnitudes of 10."

Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions do not match the expected values based on the provided recurrence relations. For example, the expected output for 'tri(3)' should be [1, 3, 2, 8], but the function does not compute the correct values for higher 'n'. The function also returns float values (e.g., 2.0, 3.0) instead of integers, which is inconsistent with the expected output format."

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where all digits are even correctly, as it will attempt to multiply an empty list, resulting in an error. The correct approach would involve converting each character back to an integer before checking if it is odd and handling the case where no odd digits are found."

For example, 'apple pi e' should return True, but the current implementation would return True only if the last character is an alphabetic character and the second last character is not a space. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or consists solely of spaces correctly, leading to potential index errors. The test cases also include assertions that would fail based on the current implementation."

For example, in the test case 'largest_smallest_integers([-1, -3, -5, -6])', the expected output is (-1, None), but the function would return (-1, None) correctly. However, in the case of 'largest_smallest_integers([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, -2])', it returns (-2, 1) which is incorrect because it should return (-2, 1) as the smallest positive integer.

exp_1_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function has_close_elements is incorrect because it does not correctly check all pairs of numbers in the list. The inner loop should iterate from i + 1 to len(numbers) - 1, but it currently iterates to len(numbers), which causes it to check the same element against itself in the last iteration. This results in incorrect behavior for certain test cases, such as when the last element is compared with itself. The test cases provided in the check function reveal this flaw, as the expected results do not match the actual outputs for some assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'separate_paren_groups' is currently not implemented and returns an empty list. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of separating groups of nested parentheses from the input string. The provided test assertions expect specific outputs based on the input strings, but since the function does not process the input at all, it will always fail these assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,CORRECT,"The function 'truncate_number' correctly computes the decimal part of a positive floating point number by subtracting the integer part (obtained using 'math.floor') from the original number. The provided test cases validate the function's correctness, as it returns the expected decimal parts for the given inputs."
exp_1_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,True,CORRECT,"The function 'below_zero' correctly implements the logic to track the balance of a bank account starting from zero. It iterates through the list of operations, updating the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance goes below zero, it returns True, which is consistent with the function's description. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate various scenarios, including edge cases, and all assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_1_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is incorrect because it uses the 'mean' function without importing it or defining it. Additionally, the calculation of the mean absolute deviation is not correctly computed as the mean of the absolute differences from the mean. The test assertions also suggest that the expected results are incorrect, as the mean absolute deviation for the provided datasets does not match the expected values in the assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function is incorrect because it does not properly handle the insertion of the delimiter between all elements of the list. The recursive call to 'intersperse' only adds the delimiter after the first element and does not continue to add it between all subsequent elements. For example, the input [2, 2, 2] with a delimiter of 2 should return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation would not produce this result correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group. The use of 'max(len(re.findall(r'\(', x)) - len(re.findall(r'\)', x))' will not yield the correct maximum depth for each group of parentheses. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses, which does not represent the depth of nesting. The correct approach would involve iterating through each character in the string and maintaining a counter for the current depth, updating the maximum depth encountered for each group."
exp_1_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_substring' is incorrect because it does not account for the case sensitivity of the substring search. The test case 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' fails because 'run' is not found in 'trumpet' or 'gruesome' when considering case sensitivity. To fix this, the comparison should be done in a case-insensitive manner, for example by converting both the string and the substring to lowercase before checking for inclusion."
exp_1_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' does not handle the case of an empty list correctly when calculating the product. The use of 'reduce' with an initial value of 1 is correct for the product, but when the list is empty, 'reduce' will not be called, and thus it will return 1 as expected. However, the product of an empty list should be defined as 1, which is correctly handled. The issue arises in the test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)', where the expected product should be 0, but the implementation will return 0 as the product of the list [100, 0] is indeed 0. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect for the assertion checks, particularly for the case where the list contains a zero."
exp_1_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'rolling_max' function does not correctly compute the rolling maximum for the given list of integers. The expected output for the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2] is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], but the function returns [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4] which is correct. However, the test case 'assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4]' is incorrect because the rolling maximum should be [1, 2, 3, 4] which is correct. The function fails to handle cases where the maximum should not change when the current number is less than the last maximum. The test case 'assert candidate([4, 3, 2, 1]) == [4, 4, 4, 4]' is also correct. The function does not account for the fact that the maximum should remain the same until a larger number is encountered. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_1_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is not being tested in the 'check' function; instead, 'is_palindrome' is being tested. The implementation of 'make_palindrome' is also incorrect because it does not correctly append the necessary characters to form the shortest palindrome. For example, 'jerry' should return 'jerryyj', but it returns 'jerryrrej'. The logic for finding the longest palindromic prefix and appending the reverse of the remaining string is flawed."
exp_1_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. In the test case candidate('111000', '101010'), the function will only compare the characters at the same indices, resulting in an incorrect output. For example, the last two characters of '111000' will not be processed, leading to a mismatch in the expected output. The function should either pad the shorter string or handle the length difference appropriately to ensure correct XOR results."
exp_1_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the 'max' function will return the last occurrence of the longest string in the list, which violates this requirement. For example, calling 'longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc', 'dd'])' would return 'ccc', which is correct, but calling 'longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc', 'dd', 'ee'])' would return 'ee' instead of 'ccc', which is incorrect. The test cases also do not cover this scenario, leading to potential unnoticed errors."
exp_1_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function cover various scenarios, including coprime numbers (3, 7), a pair with a common divisor (10, 15), and cases with larger numbers (49, 14 and 144, 60). All assertions in the check function pass, confirming that the implementation is functioning as expected."
exp_1_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,INCORRECT,"The function all_prefixes is expected to return a list of prefixes from shortest to longest. However, the implementation includes an empty string as the first element in the list, which is not consistent with the expected output. The correct output for an empty string should be an empty list, and for non-empty strings, it should start from the first character. The test case for an empty string is correct, but the implementation does not handle the prefix generation correctly as it includes an empty string prefix."
exp_1_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The correct implementation should return a string with space-delimited numbers, but the current implementation returns a concatenated string without spaces. For example, calling string_sequence(5) should return '0 1 2 3 4 5', but it currently returns '012345'. This discrepancy leads to the failure of the test assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters correctly counts the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The implementation uses the set data structure to eliminate duplicates and the lower() method to ensure case insensitivity. The provided test cases validate the function's correctness, including edge cases like an empty string and varying cases of characters."
exp_1_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'parse_music' does not correctly implement the logic to parse the input string and convert musical notes into their corresponding beat values. Instead of parsing the input string and returning a list of integers based on the defined legend, it returns a hardcoded list. This leads to incorrect results for the provided test assertions, which expect the function to dynamically generate the output based on the input string."
exp_1_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'how_many_times' uses the string method 'count', which does not account for overlapping occurrences of the substring. For example, in the string 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', the expected count is 3 (the occurrences are at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but 'count' will return 2. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement to count overlapping cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function sort_numbers does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sort() method sorts the words lexicographically (alphabetically), which does not correspond to their numerical values. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted words, resulting in a concatenated string without spaces. The function should map the words to their corresponding numerical values, sort those values, and then convert them back to words before returning the result."
exp_1_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic used to find the closest pair only tracks the index of one of the closest numbers, but it does not correctly identify the second number. Specifically, the return statement uses 'min_diff_index + 1', which does not guarantee that the second number is the closest to the first. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the closest pair is not adjacent in the original list. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the correct closest pair is (3.9, 4.0), but the function may return (3.9, 5.0) or another incorrect pair depending on the indices tracked."
exp_1_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'rescale_to_unit' is designed to rescale a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output is reversed. The correct output should be [1.0, 0.0] since 100.0 is the maximum and 49.9 is the minimum, but the function does not handle this case correctly. The output should be [1.0, 0.0] as expected, but the function will return [0.0, 1.0] instead. This indicates that the function does not correctly handle cases where the maximum value is the first element and the minimum is the second."
exp_1_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various scenarios, including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass successfully, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_1_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strlen' correctly returns the length of the given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, all of which are correctly handled by the function. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_1_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' is supposed to return the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n'. However, the current implementation starts the loop from 'n' and checks for divisibility, which will always return 'n' itself on the first iteration. This means that the function does not correctly find the largest divisor smaller than 'n'. For example, calling 'largest_divisor(15)' will return 15 instead of 5, which is incorrect. The test cases in the 'check' function also expect the function to return 1 for prime numbers, which is correct, but the implementation fails for composite numbers as described."
exp_1_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the factorize function correctly computes the prime factors of a given integer, including their multiplicities. The function handles even numbers first, then iterates through odd numbers up to the square root of n, which is an efficient approach for factorization. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including prime numbers, powers of primes, and products of distinct primes, and all assertions pass successfully. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_1_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation does not achieve this correctly. The test case assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == [1, 4, 5] fails because the number 3 appears twice and should be removed, but the implementation incorrectly retains the first occurrence of 3. The correct output for this input should be [1, 4, 5], but the function retains elements that appear only once, which is not the intended behavior."
exp_1_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly implements the functionality of flipping the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'swapcase()' effectively changes lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

exp_1_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The function 'concatenate' correctly implements the logic to concatenate a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for both an empty list and a list of strings, returning the correct concatenated result."
exp_1_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')) expects the output to be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA']. The function does not include the last 'xxx' because it is not unique in the list, which is not the expected behavior based on the description. The function should return all instances of strings that start with the prefix, regardless of their uniqueness."
exp_1_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function 'get_positive' correctly implements the logic to filter and return only positive numbers from the input list. The test assertions provided in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various cases, including lists with negative numbers, mixed numbers, and empty lists. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for primality. The loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. It should only check up to the square root of n for factors. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of n being less than 2 correctly, as it should return False for 0 and negative numbers, which it does. However, the inefficiency in the loop can lead to performance issues for larger numbers."
exp_1_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `poly` function contains an error in the polynomial evaluation formula. The comment states that the polynomial should be evaluated as 'xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n', but the code incorrectly uses 'xs[1] * x^2' for both the first and second coefficients. The correct implementation should use 'xs[i] * x^i' for each coefficient, which is what the code attempts to do. However, the comment itself is misleading and incorrect, as it suggests that the first coefficient is multiplied by `x` instead of `x^0`. This discrepancy may lead to confusion. Additionally, the `find_zero` function assumes that the polynomial has a root based on the coefficients provided, but it does not guarantee that the method used will find a root for all polynomials, especially if the polynomial is not well-behaved. The test assertions in the `check` function do not validate the correctness of the `find_zero` function, as they only check if the polynomial evaluates to zero at the found solution without ensuring that the solution is valid for all cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it appends the sorted value of the individual element at that index, which is incorrect. For example, in the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], where the values at indices 0 and 6 (which are divisible by 3) should be sorted together. The current implementation fails to achieve this, leading to incorrect results in the assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly removes duplicates from the list and converts it to a set, but it does not sort the unique elements before returning them. The expected output is a sorted list of unique elements, but the current implementation does not guarantee the order of elements since sets are unordered.

The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum value in that list is actually 124, not 123 as stated in the original docstring. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the implementation does not pass all assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' correctly. The test cases provided in the check function do not match the expected behavior described in the docstring. For example, the expected output for fizz_buzz(78) is 2, but the function does not correctly account for all numbers divisible by 11 or 13 that contain the digit '7'. The function fails to return the correct counts for larger values as well, indicating that the logic for counting occurrences of '7' is flawed or the test cases are incorrect."

The function concatenates the sorted even-indexed values with the odd-indexed values, which results in a list that does not preserve the original order of odd-indexed elements. For example, the input [5, 6, 3, 4] should return [3, 6, 5, 4] according to the description, but the function returns [3, 6, 5, 4] which is correct. However, the second test case fails as it does not maintain the odd indices correctly. The expected output for the second test case is not achieved, indicating that the implementation is flawed."
exp_1_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is incorrectly testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' equals the original string 'str', but it is currently checking 'encode_cyclic(encoded_str)', which does not make sense. Additionally, the 'decode_cyclic' function is not being tested at all. Therefore, the implementation is flawed as it does not validate the correctness of the encoding and decoding process."

The correct values should be candidate(6) == 21 (which is correct) and candidate(11) == 66 (which is also correct). The function itself is implemented correctly, but the test assertions are inconsistent with the expected output for the given inputs."

For each opening bracket '(', it pushes it onto the stack, and for each closing bracket ')', it checks if there is a corresponding opening bracket by checking if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty when encountering a closing bracket, it returns False. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty, which indicates that all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, and the function passes all assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the coefficients of the derivative polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients [a0, a1, a2, ..., an] should be [a1, 2*a2, 3*a3, ..., n*an]. The current implementation incorrectly uses the length of the input list to determine the power of x, which leads to incorrect results. For example, for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the expected derivative is [1, 4, 12, 20], but the function returns [1, 4, 12, 20] correctly. However, for the input [3, 2, 1, 0, 4], the expected derivative is [2, 2, 0, 16], but the function returns [2, 2, 0, 16] correctly. The test case with a single coefficient [1] should return an empty list, which is correct. However, the overall logic for calculating the derivative coefficients is flawed."
exp_1_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function correctly follows the defined rules of the FibFib sequence.

The recursive case correctly sums the values of fibfib(n-1), fibfib(n-2), and fibfib(n-3). The provided test assertions in the check function also confirm that the implementation produces the correct outputs for the specified inputs, including fibfib(5) returning 4, fibfib(8) returning 24, and others. Therefore, the implementation is correct."

Specifically, the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is '001', but the function will return '00' instead, as it does not account for leading zeros when shifting. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' is incorrect because the expected output should be '79', but the function will return '97' since the shift exceeds the number of digits. Thus, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

However, the implementation only extracts the number of apples and oranges from the string using fixed indices (0 and 2), which assumes a specific format. This will fail if the input string format changes or if there are more than two words before 'and'. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion that expects a result of 10 for the input '5 apples and 6 oranges' with a total of 21, which is incorrect as the expected result should be 10. The function does not handle all cases correctly, leading to incorrect results."

While it correctly identifies even numbers and finds the minimum even value, it does not correctly return the index of the first occurrence of that minimum even value. The method 'even_values.index(min(even_values))' will return the index of the first occurrence of the minimum value in the 'even_values' list, which may not correspond to the index in the original 'arr'. This is evident in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) == [0, 1]', where the first occurrence of 0 is at index 1 in 'even_values', but its index in 'arr' is 1, which is correct. However, the test case 'assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 3]) == [0, 3]' will fail because the index of 0 in 'arr' is 3, but the index in 'even_values' will be 0. Thus, the function does not satisfy the requirement of returning the index of the first occurrence of the smallest even value in the original array."
exp_1_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'search' is not implemented, meaning it lacks the necessary logic to fulfill the requirements outlined in the docstring.

exp_1_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly achieve the desired strange sorting order as described in the comments. The current implementation uses 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x%2)', which sorts the list based on whether the numbers are odd or even, rather than alternating between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, such as 'strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])' returning [1, 2, 3, 4] instead of the expected [1, 4, 2, 3]."

The current logic only checks if the number can be expressed as the product of two prime numbers (i and a/i), not three. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the product of three primes is needed, nor does it check for combinations of three primes. The test case assertions also reveal issues: for example, is_multiply_prime(8) should return False (2 * 2 * 2 is not three distinct primes), and is_multiply_prime(125) should return False (5 * 5 * 5 is not three distinct primes). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_1_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function is_simple_power is incorrect because it does not accurately determine if x is a simple power of n. The condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to the way integer conversion and logarithmic calculations work. For example, for is_simple_power(9, 3), the logarithm calculation would yield 2, and thus it would evaluate to 9 == 3**2, which is true, but 9 is indeed a simple power of 3. However, the assertion for candidate(9, 3) in the check function expects it to return True, which contradicts the expected behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x is not a power of n correctly, leading to potential false positives or negatives."

The expression 'a**(1/3) == int(a**(1/3))' does not account for floating-point precision issues, which can lead to incorrect results for certain integers. For example, while it correctly identifies 1, -1, 64, and 0 as cubes, it may fail for other numbers due to rounding errors. A more reliable approach would be to check if the cube of the rounded result of 'a**(1/3)' equals 'a'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect as 1729 is not a perfect cube, but the assertion is checking against 1728 instead."

The condition 'if s[i:i + 3] == s[i + 1:i + 4]' only checks if the first two characters of the 3-character substring are the same, which is insufficient. For example, the string 'abc' would pass this check, but it should return True since all characters are distinct. The correct approach should involve checking if all three characters in the substring are distinct, which can be done by checking if the set of the substring has a length of 3."

Specifically, it returns True for a string of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the loop that checks for factors of the string length does not correctly handle the case when the length is 2, as it should return True for prime lengths. The function should return False for lengths that are divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, and it should also handle edge cases correctly."

However, the implementation counts all n-digit integers that start with 1 or end with 1. For n=1, the only number is 1, which is correct. For n=2, the valid numbers are 10, 11, and 01 (but 01 is not a valid 2-digit number), so the count should be 18 (10-19 and 1x, where x is 0-9). For n=3, the valid numbers are 100-199 (100 numbers) and 1xx (where x can be 0-9, giving 10 more), and also 200-999 (ending with 1), leading to a total of 180 valid numbers. The same logic applies for n=4 and n=5. The function does not account for the fact that leading zeros are not valid in positive integers, which leads to incorrect counts for n > 1."
exp_1_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the sum of the digits of the integer N when represented in binary, but it instead returns the binary representation of N itself. For example, for N = 1000, the binary representation is '1111101000', and the sum of its digits (which is 5) should be converted to binary, resulting in '101'. The test cases provided in the 'check' function expect the output to be the binary representation of the sum of the binary digits, which is not what the current implementation does."

However, the implementation only sums the elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 88])', the function returns 88, which is correct, but in 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', it returns 122, which is incorrect because 5 (at index 1) is not even. The correct implementation should filter for even numbers at odd indices before summing them."
exp_1_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function anti_shuffle does not correctly implement the requirement to sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces in the input string.

For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the expected output is None because there is no distinct second smallest element. However, the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly, as seen in the test case with negative values. The function should first convert the list to a set to remove duplicates before sorting, ensuring that the second smallest element is distinct."

For example, the input 'apple' should return False, but the current implementation would incorrectly return True because it only checks the last character. Additionally, the function does not account for cases where the last character is a letter but is preceded by a space, which should return False.

Additionally, the function does not check if the substring before the dot starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet correctly, as it only checks if the first character is a digit. The function fails to handle various test cases correctly, such as 'I563_No.exe' which should return 'No' due to having more than three digits. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

This means that once an element is squared or cubed, it will affect subsequent calculations in the same iteration, leading to incorrect results. For example, if an index is both a multiple of 3 and 4, it will be squared first and then potentially cubed in the next iteration, which is not intended. The function should instead create a new list to store the modified values before summing them up. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030' fails because the expected output is incorrect based on the function's logic.

This is evident in the test case 'assert candidate([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]', where the output does not preserve the original order of '-1' and '1'.

exp_2_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is incorrect because it uses the 'mean' function without importing it or defining it. Additionally, the calculation of the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is based on the assumption that the mean is correctly calculated, which is not shown in the provided code. The test assertions also indicate that the expected results are incorrect; for example, the expected MAD for the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3, but the actual calculation is not verified due to the missing mean function."
exp_2_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly handle the insertion of the delimiter between all consecutive elements. Specifically, the function currently adds a delimiter after the first element and then recursively processes the rest of the list. This results in an incorrect output for cases where the list has more than two elements. For example, the input [2, 2, 2] with a delimiter of 2 should produce [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation would produce [2, 2, 2, 2], which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve iterating through the list and adding the delimiter between each pair of elements."
exp_2_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. The current approach simply counts the total number of opening and closing parentheses, which does not account for the actual nesting levels. For example, the input '(()())' should return 2, but the implementation would incorrectly return 0 because it computes the difference between the counts of '(' and ')'. A correct implementation would require tracking the current depth as it iterates through the characters in the string and updating the maximum depth accordingly."
exp_2_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_substring is designed to filter strings that contain a given substring. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is incorrect because 'trumpet' and 'gruesome' do not contain the substring 'run', but 'grunt' does. The expected output should be ['grunt'] instead of ['grunt', 'prune']. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the expected results for this test case."
exp_2_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The use of 'reduce' from the 'functools' module is missing, which would cause a NameError. Additionally, the product of an empty list should return 1, but the current implementation will raise an error when trying to compute the product of an empty list. The test cases also reveal that the product of [100, 0] is incorrectly expected to be 0, which is correct, but the implementation does not handle the empty case correctly."
exp_2_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'rolling_max' function correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It iterates through the list, and for each index, it calculates the maximum of the sublist from the start to the current index. The provided test cases in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various scenarios, including an empty list and lists with increasing, decreasing, and mixed values."
exp_2_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is incorrectly implemented. The test assertions provided in the 'check' function are meant to validate the 'make_palindrome' function, but the check is mistakenly applied to 'is_palindrome'. Additionally, the logic in 'make_palindrome' does not correctly construct the shortest palindrome for all cases. For example, the test case 'jerry' should return 'jerryrrej', but the implementation does not guarantee this outcome due to the incorrect handling of the palindromic suffix and prefix concatenation."
exp_2_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '0's and '1's. However, the test case candidate('111000', '101010') is expected to return '010010', which is incorrect. The correct result of the XOR operation for these inputs should be '010010', but the implementation does not handle cases where the strings are of different lengths. The function assumes both strings are of equal length, which leads to incorrect results when they are not. Additionally, the XOR operation is correctly implemented, but the function will raise an error if the lengths of the input strings differ."
exp_2_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `longest` does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the `max` function will return the last occurrence of the maximum length string, which violates this requirement. For example, in the test case `longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])`, the expected output is 'yyy' (the first string with the maximum length), but the current implementation would return 'zzzz'."
exp_2_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test assertions in the check function cover various cases, including coprime numbers (3 and 7), a case with a common divisor (10 and 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49 and 14), and a case with larger numbers (144 and 60). All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected according to the provided examples and additional tests."
exp_2_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,INCORRECT,"The function all_prefixes is expected to return prefixes from shortest to longest, but the implementation includes an empty string as the first prefix. The expected output for an empty input string should be an empty list, but the implementation returns a list that includes an empty string as the first element. The test cases also expect the output to match the specified behavior, which is not satisfied by the current implementation."
exp_2_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The function string_sequence is supposed to return a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 to n inclusive. However, the implementation uses ''.join() without a space delimiter, which results in the numbers being concatenated without spaces. For example, string_sequence(5) would return '012345' instead of '0 1 2 3 4 5'. This is confirmed by the test assertions, which would fail for any n > 0."
exp_2_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters correctly counts the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The implementation uses set to store unique characters after converting the string to lowercase, which aligns with the function's description. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness, including edge cases like an empty string and strings with varying cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical note legend. Instead of returning a list of integers based on the input string, it returns a hardcoded list. The function does not account for the different note representations ('o', 'o|', and '.|') and their corresponding beat values. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for any input other than the hardcoded output."
exp_2_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring within the string. The current approach calculates the difference in length between the original string and the string with the substring removed, which does not account for cases where the substring overlaps. For example, in the case of 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', the expected count is 3 (the overlaps 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the implementation would return 2. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sort method used on the list of words sorts them lexicographically (alphabetically) rather than numerically. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect for numerical order. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which causes the output to be concatenated without spaces between the words."
exp_2_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic used to find the closest pair only tracks the index of one of the closest elements, but it does not correctly identify the second closest element. Specifically, it always returns the element at 'min_diff_index' and the next element in the list, which may not be the closest pair. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the expected output is (3.9, 4.0), but the function would incorrectly return (3.9, 2.2) or similar incorrect pairs depending on the indices. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_2_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the minimum and maximum values are the same. In such cases, the denominator (max_val - min_val) becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. For example, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because it expects the output to be [1.0, 0.0], but the function will raise an error due to division by zero. The function should include a check to handle this scenario."
exp_2_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions also cover various cases, including empty lists and lists with mixed types, and they confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_2_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the correctness of 'strlen' against various cases, including an empty string and non-empty strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_2_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is supposed to return the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. However, the implementation starts checking from n down to 1, and it will return n itself if n is a prime number (e.g., for n = 3 or n = 7). The correct behavior should return 1 for prime numbers, as 1 is the only divisor smaller than the number itself. The test cases in the check function expect this behavior, which the current implementation does not satisfy."
exp_2_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'factorize' does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. The inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect factorization, especially for composite numbers. For example, when testing with 'factorize(70)', the expected output is [2, 5, 7], but the function may not produce this result consistently due to the way it handles the factorization. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input number is prime or where multiple factors are present correctly, as it stops after finding the first factor. This leads to incorrect results for various test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation does not correctly achieve this. The current implementation retains elements that occur only once, but it does not remove all duplicates as specified. For example, the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) is expected to return [1, 4, 5], but it fails to account for the fact that both 2 and 3 appear more than once and should be removed entirely. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly uses the 'swapcase()' method to flip the case of each character in the input string.

All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_2_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')) is expected to return ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but it actually returns ['xxx', 'xxx'] because the function does not account for case sensitivity and does not include 'xxxAAA' as it does not start with 'xxx' in a case-sensitive manner. The expected output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] but the actual output is ['xxx', 'xxx']."
exp_2_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function 'get_positive' correctly implements the logic to filter out only positive numbers from the input list. The list comprehension used in the function effectively checks each element 'x' in the list 'l' and includes it in the result if 'x' is greater than 0.

exp_2_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for primality. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so it suffices to check for factors up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of 0 and negative numbers correctly, as they should also return False. The test cases include checks for 5, 17, and composite numbers that are not handled correctly by the current implementation."
exp_2_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `find_zero` function is incorrect. The logic used to find the zero of the polynomial does not guarantee that it will find a root correctly. The method of calculating `x` by iterating through half of the coefficients and performing a subtraction does not correspond to any standard root-finding algorithm. Additionally, the test assertions in the `check` function are designed to validate the `find_zero` function, but it incorrectly checks the `poly` function instead. The `check` function should be testing `find_zero`, not `poly`, which leads to a mismatch in the expected behavior."
exp_2_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' is incorrect because it does not properly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it appends the sorted result of the individual elements (which is incorrect since 'l[i]' is an integer and 'sorted(l[i])' is invalid). The correct approach should involve collecting the values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back into their respective positions in the new list while keeping other values unchanged."
exp_2_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list.

exp_2_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function max_element is correct, as it uses the built-in max function to return the maximum element from the list. However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The second assertion checks for the maximum value in the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], which should return 124, but the provided test case in the docstring indicates that the maximum value is 123. This discrepancy indicates that the test cases are not aligned with the expected output, leading to an incorrect evaluation of the function."
exp_2_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the fizz_buzz function correctly counts the occurrences of the digit '7' in integers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. The test assertions provided in the check function validate the correctness of the implementation against expected outputs for various inputs. The function iterates through the range from 1 to n-1, checks divisibility by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of '7' in those numbers, which aligns with the function's description."
exp_2_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly maintain the values at odd indices while sorting the even indices. The implementation concatenates the sorted even indices with the odd indices, but it does not place the odd indices back into their original positions in the final list. For example, in the test case 'sort_even([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])', the expected output is '[-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123]', but the function returns '[-12, 3, 5, 2, -3, 3, 8, 0, 9, 1, 123]', which is incorrect."

However, the implementation only handles the first two cases (n = 1 and n = 2) correctly by returning 2 and 3, respectively. For n >= 3, it calls a function 'fib(n)', which is not defined in the provided code. This will lead to a NameError when n is greater than 2. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime; thus, the function does not correctly implement the requirement to find Fibonacci numbers that are also prime."
exp_2_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify all combinations of three distinct elements that sum to zero. The initial check for zero is misleading and does not relate to the requirement of finding three distinct elements. Additionally, the nested loops do not guarantee that the elements are distinct due to the way duplicates are handled. For example, the input [1, 3, -2, 1] should return True, but the logic may fail in certain cases where duplicates are present. The test cases also include scenarios that are not adequately covered by the implementation."

The current implementation only checks for lowercase vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and will miss uppercase vowels and the condition for 'y'. For example, 'Alone' should return 3 (counting 'A', 'o', 'e'), and 'key' should return 2 (counting 'e' and 'y'). Additionally, the test cases do not cover all scenarios, such as words ending with 'y' or containing uppercase vowels."

According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the string representation of 'x' when the shift is greater than the length of 'x', which is correct. The issue arises with the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""', which fails because the expected output is incorrect. The correct output for 'circular_shift(100, 2)' should be '00' (the last two digits shifted to the front), not '001'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the expected behavior as described in the comments."

exp_2_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'fruit_distribution' does not correctly handle the extraction of the number of oranges from the input string. The code assumes that the number of oranges is always at the second position in the split string, which is not guaranteed. For example, in the test case '1 apples and 100 oranges', the function will incorrectly extract '0' instead of '100' for the number of oranges, leading to incorrect results. The correct extraction should account for the variable position of the orange count in the string."
exp_2_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly return the index of the smallest even value. The issue arises because the index is being calculated based on the list of even values, which does not correspond to the original array's indices. For example, in the case of the input [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2], the smallest even value is 0, which appears at indices 1 and 3 in the original array. The function will return [0, 1] instead of [0, 1] as expected, but it will fail for other cases where the smallest even value appears multiple times. The index should be derived from the original array, not from the filtered list of even values."

The current logic sorts the list and checks each integer against its frequency, but it returns the first integer that satisfies the condition, rather than the greatest one. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1, but the function will return 5, which is incorrect. Additionally, the frequency check is done using 'lst.count(lst[i])', which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results if the list contains duplicates. The function should instead iterate through unique values and check their frequencies to find the maximum valid integer."
exp_2_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly sort the list in the specified 'strange order'. The current implementation simply returns the first element, recursively processes the rest of the list, and appends the last element, which does not achieve the desired alternating minimum and maximum sorting. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4] should yield [1, 4, 2, 3], but the current implementation would not produce this result. The function needs to be restructured to properly alternate between the minimum and maximum values from the remaining elements."

The formula used, round(0.5 * (a * b * c) ** (1/2), 2), does not represent the correct method for calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides. The correct method is to use Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for the test case triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433. Therefore, the function fails to produce the correct area for valid triangles and does not handle the area calculation properly."

According to the problem description, an empty list should return False, which the current implementation does correctly. However, the logic for checking if the list is balanced (palindromic) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight is flawed. Specifically, the function first checks if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to w, and only then checks if the list is a palindrome. This means that if the sum exceeds w, it does not check for balance at all, which is incorrect. The function should first check if the list is a palindrome and then check the sum against w. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input list contains negative numbers or non-integer values, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_2_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `smallest_change` is overly complex and does not correctly handle all cases for arrays of length greater than 5. The logic is hardcoded for specific lengths, which limits its functionality and correctness. For example, it does not correctly calculate the number of changes needed for arrays longer than 5 elements. The test cases provided in the `check` function include scenarios that the current implementation cannot handle correctly, leading to incorrect results. A more generalized approach using a two-pointer technique would be more appropriate to determine the minimum changes needed to make the array palindromic."

According to the function's description, if one list has a total character count less than the other, it should return that list. However, when the first list is empty and the second list is not (e.g., total_match([], ['this'])), the function incorrectly returns the first list (which is empty) instead of the second list. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is incorrect because the total character count of the second list is greater than that of the first list, so the expected output should be ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, the implementation only checks if the number can be divided by a prime number and then checks if the quotient is also prime. This approach does not guarantee that the number is a product of exactly three primes. For example, the number 8 (which is 2 * 2 * 2) is incorrectly asserted to be true, as it is not a product of three distinct primes. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where the product of three primes could include repetitions or combinations that do not yield a valid product of three primes. The test cases also include incorrect assertions, such as 125 being true, which is not a product of three primes. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the function's docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' is incorrect. The condition 'if x == n ** int(x / n)' does not correctly determine if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. The expression 'int(x / n)' does not yield the correct exponent for checking if 'n' raised to that exponent equals 'x'. Instead, the function should check if there exists an integer 'k' such that 'n**k = x'. The test cases also reveal that the function fails to return the expected results for certain inputs, such as 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' which should return True, but the current implementation would not handle this correctly."

The expression 'a**(1/3) == int(a**(1/3))' does not account for floating-point precision issues, which can lead to incorrect results for certain integers. For example, 'iscube(8)' would return False because '8**(1/3)' is approximately 2.0, and 'int(2.0)' is 2, which does not equal 2.0. A more reliable approach would be to check if the cube of the rounded value of 'a**(1/3)' equals 'a'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect; it should check '1728', which is a perfect cube (12^3)."

However, the implementation only counts the occurrences of the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F, which are not all prime digits. The prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), and D (13). The function fails to account for the digits '2', '3', '5', and '7', which are also prime. Therefore, the output of the function will not match the expected results for the provided test cases."

The current implementation only checks if any three consecutive letters are the same, which is not sufficient. For example, the string 'abcabc' should return True because all groups of three consecutive letters ('abc', 'bca', 'cab') are distinct, but the current implementation would incorrectly return False because it does not account for distinctness across the entire string. The correct logic should check if s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] are all different."

Specifically, the function incorrectly assigns the letter grade 'D+' for a GPA of exactly 1.0, while it should assign 'D' for any GPA less than 1.0 and greater than or equal to 0.7. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where a GPA of 0.0 should return 'E'. The expected output for the test case 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' is incorrect; it should return 'C-' instead of 'D+'. The grading logic needs to be adjusted to ensure it follows the specified ranges accurately."
exp_2_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prime_length' is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether the length of the string is a prime number.

However, for n = 2, the numbers that start or end with 1 are 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, and 1, which gives a total of 18. The function correctly returns 18 for n = 2, but it does not scale well for larger n. The correct approach would involve calculating the counts mathematically rather than iterating through all possibilities. For n = 3, the count should be 180, but the function's method of counting may lead to inefficiencies and potential inaccuracies for larger n."

However, for N = 150, the sum of its digits is 6, and the expected output is '110', but the function will return '10010110', which is the binary representation of 150. Similarly, for N = 147, the sum of its digits is 12, and the expected output is '1100', but the function will return '10010011'.

The function only checks the length of the array and does not sort the array correctly for lengths greater than 2. Additionally, the function does not return a sorted copy of the array; it simply returns the original array in reverse order for even sums, which is not the intended behavior. The correct implementation should sort the array in ascending order if the sum is odd and in descending order if the sum is even, regardless of the length of the array."
exp_2_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encrypt' function does not correctly perform the intended rotation of the alphabet. The function is overly complicated and does not effectively shift the letters by two positions down the alphabet.

For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the function returns 1, which is incorrect because there is no distinct second smallest element. The function should return None in such cases. Additionally, the case next_smallest([1, 0**0]) is also problematic because 0**0 is considered 1 in Python, leading to the same issue.

For example, the input 'I love It !' should return 1, but the current implementation would not correctly identify the sentence structure.

However, for multiply(148, 412), the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16, which is also correct. The test case multiply(14, -15) should return 20, but the unit digits are 4 and 5, which multiply to 20, so this is also correct. The issue arises with the test case multiply(76, 67), which should return 42, but the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42, making this correct as well. The function fails to account for negative numbers correctly in the context of the problem description, which states that the input is always valid.

The problem statement specifies that the input should be an array of non-negative integers, but the test cases include negative integers. The expected outputs in the test cases do not match the actual outputs produced by the function. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]) == [-4, -2, -6, -5, -3]' is incorrect because the function does not account for negative numbers, which are not valid inputs according to the problem description."

First, it converts the entire word to lowercase, which causes it to lose case sensitivity, contradicting the requirement to return vowels in a case-sensitive manner. Additionally, the function does not correctly identify the closest vowel between two consonants; it simply returns the character immediately after the second consonant without checking if it is a vowel. For example, in the test case get_closest_vowel('FULL'), it returns 'u' as expected, but for 'full', it incorrectly returns 'u' instead of 'U'. The test cases also include 'Above', which should return 'o' but would not be handled correctly due to the lowercase conversion. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

Additionally, the base case for k == 1 does not check if the single element is within the two-digit limit. The function needs to filter the elements based on their digit count before summing them."

Additionally, the logic for counting lowercase letters with odd positions in the alphabet is incorrect; it should count letters based on their positions rather than using the `count` method. The test cases also reveal that the function does not handle cases with mixed punctuation correctly, such as 'Hello,Hello,world !'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

For example, for the input [1, 2, 2, -4], the expected output is -9, but the function will return -1 (the product of the signs) instead. Additionally, the function returns 0 immediately if any element is zero, which is not aligned with the requirement to return the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of signs. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The condition ']' in string and '[' in string and ']' in string.replace('[', '') is insufficient. For example, it would return True for the input '[]', which does not contain any nested brackets. The function fails to check for actual nesting, which requires that there be at least one pair of brackets where one is inside another, such as in '[[]]'. Therefore, the implementation does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the function description."

The math.ceil function rounds towards positive infinity, which means that for negative numbers, it will round to a less negative number (closer to zero). For example, math.ceil(-2.4) results in -2, and when squared, it gives 4 instead of the expected 6 when summed with the squares of the other numbers. Therefore, the output for the test case [-2.4,1,1] is incorrect."

However, this does not align with the requirement that the last character should not be part of a word. For example, in the case of 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed a letter and is not part of a word, so it should return True. However, the implementation incorrectly checks if 'e' is not in 'apple pi ', which is not the intended logic. Thus, the function fails to return the correct results for the provided test cases."

The current implementation only updates 'a' if it finds a negative integer that is greater than the current value of 'a'. However, it should be tracking the largest negative integer, which means it should update 'a' if it finds a negative integer that is less than the current value of 'a'. For example, in the case of the input [-1, -3, -5, -6], the function returns -1, which is correct, but in the case of [-6, -4, -4, -3, 1], it incorrectly returns -3 instead of -4, which is the largest negative integer. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no positive integers correctly, as it returns None for 'b' but does not account for the absence of positive integers in the logic."

The current implementation checks if n is equal to the sum of all even numbers up to n, which does not align with the requirement of summing exactly 4 positive even numbers. For example, the sum of the first four positive even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) is 20, and the function would incorrectly return results based on the total sum of even numbers rather than checking combinations of exactly four even numbers."

The current implementation only checks if the substring before the dot has more than three characters, which is incorrect. Additionally, it does not count the digits in the entire file name. For example, 'MY16FILE3.exe' should return 'No' because it contains four digits. Furthermore, the check for the substring before the dot being empty is not explicitly handled, as it only checks the length of the substring but does not ensure it starts with a letter. The function also fails to return 'No' for cases where the file name has multiple dots or invalid extensions. Therefore, the function does not meet all the specified conditions for a valid file name."

However, the current implementation first squares the number at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 3, and then it checks if 'i' is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3 to cube it. This means that if 'i' is both a multiple of 3 and 4 (like 0, 12, etc.), it will only be squared and not cubed, which is incorrect. Additionally, the test cases include scenarios that are not covered by the function's logic, leading to incorrect results for those cases. For example, the test case with input [-56,-99,1,0,-2] should yield a different result than what the function currently produces."

Additionally, the output string is constructed without spaces between the words, which contradicts the requirement to maintain the order and separation of words from the original sentence. The test cases also include assertions that expect certain outputs which will not be met due to these issues."

The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality rather than determining if the product is a whole number. To check if the product x * n is a whole number, we should verify if (x_num * n_num) is divisible by (x_den * n_den). This means the correct condition should be 'if (x_num * n_num) % (x_den * n_den) == 0'. As a result, the function will fail for some test cases, such as 'simplify(""1/5"", ""1/5"")' which should return True, but will return False due to the incorrect logic."

For example, for the number 125, the first digit is 1 (which is odd), but the condition will fail because 12 (the result of num // 10) is even. Therefore, the function will incorrectly count numbers that have an odd first digit but an even second digit. The test cases provided in the 'check' function may pass for some cases, but they will fail for others where the first digit is odd but the second digit is even."

This means that it could potentially skip over an extension that should be selected based on its position in the list. For example, if the extensions are ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A'], the function would incorrectly return 'C' instead of the first 'A' if they have the same strength."

exp_3_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly handle the case where the input list has more than one element. The function recursively adds the first element, then the delimiter, and calls itself with the rest of the list. However, this leads to an incorrect output because it adds an extra delimiter at the end of the list. For example, calling intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2) should yield [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation would produce [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. The function needs to ensure that the delimiter is only added between elements and not after the last element."
exp_3_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group. Instead of counting the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses, it simply counts the total number of parentheses in the entire string. This leads to incorrect results, as the depth of nesting should be calculated for each individual group of parentheses separately. The correct approach would involve iterating through each character in the string, maintaining a counter for the current depth, and updating the maximum depth for each group accordingly."
exp_3_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_substring is intended to filter strings that contain the specified substring. However, the test case 'check' includes an assertion that expects 'grunt' and 'prune' to be returned when filtering with the substring 'run'. Neither 'grunt' nor 'prune' contains the substring 'run', which makes this assertion incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The 'reduce' function is not imported from 'functools', which will lead to a NameError. Additionally, the product of an empty list should return 1, but if 'numbers' is empty, 'reduce' will not execute and will return the default value of 1, which is correct. However, if the list contains a zero, the product will incorrectly return 0 instead of the expected behavior of returning the product of all numbers. The test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)' is also misleading as it suggests that the product should be 0, which is correct, but does not test the function's behavior with an empty list. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements stated in the docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'rolling_max' function does not handle the case when the input list is empty. When an empty list is passed, it will raise an IndexError because it tries to access the first element of the list with 'numbers[0]'. Additionally, the expected output for the test case 'rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4])' is incorrect; the output should be [1, 2, 3, 4], which is correct, but the function does not handle the empty list case properly."
exp_3_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' is correctly implemented, but the function 'make_palindrome' does not produce the expected results for all test cases. Specifically, the test case 'make_palindrome('jerry')' should return 'jerryrrej', but the implementation does not correctly append the necessary characters to form a palindrome. The logic in the loop that constructs the palindrome is flawed, as it does not correctly handle the case where the longest palindromic prefix is not at the end of the string."
exp_3_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. For example, if 'a' is '010' and 'b' is '110', the function will only process the first three characters of each string, which is correct in this case. However, the test case '111000' and '101010' will yield '010010', which is incorrect because the function does not account for the lengths of the strings. The expected output for '111000' XOR '101010' should be '010010', which is correct, but the implementation will fail for cases where the lengths differ. Therefore, the implementation is not robust and does not meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_3_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the use of 'max' with 'key=len' will return the last string with the maximum length instead of the first one. For example, in the test case 'check(candidate(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])', the expected output is 'yyy' since it is the first string of maximum length 3, but the function will return 'zzzz'."
exp_3_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test assertions in the check function cover various cases, including coprime numbers (3, 7), a case with a common divisor (10, 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49, 14), and a case with larger numbers (144, 60). All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_3_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over the range of the string's length plus one, which includes the empty prefix. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various scenarios, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, all of which return the expected results."
exp_3_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The correct implementation should use ' '.join(...) instead of ''.join(...). This leads to the output being a concatenation of numbers without spaces, which fails the provided test assertions."
exp_3_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly counts the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. The use of 'set' ensures that only unique characters are considered, and converting the string to lowercase before creating the set effectively handles case insensitivity. The provided test cases validate the function's correctness, including edge cases like an empty string and varying cases of the same characters."
exp_3_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the musical notes according to the specified format. The function treats each character in the input string individually, which leads to incorrect parsing of multi-character notes like 'o|' and '.|'. Instead, it should split the input string into separate notes and then evaluate each note. For example, the input 'o| o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o' would not be parsed correctly, resulting in an incorrect output."
exp_3_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'how_many_times' does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string. The method 'string.count(substring)' only counts non-overlapping occurrences. For example, in the case of 'how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')', the expected result is 3 (the occurrences are 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the current implementation would return 2. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sorting is done lexicographically (alphabetically) rather than numerically. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect in terms of numerical order. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which results in the output being concatenated without spaces. The expected output for the test case 'five zero four seven nine eight' should be 'zero four five seven eight nine', but the current implementation would not produce this correctly."
exp_3_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic only tracks the index of one of the closest elements but does not find the correct pair. Specifically, it returns 'numbers[min_diff_index]' and 'numbers[min_diff_index + 1]', which does not guarantee that these two numbers are the closest to each other. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the expected output is (3.9, 4.0), but the function would return (2.2, 3.9) instead, which is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is correct in terms of rescaling the values between 0 and 1. However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [1.0, 0.0] but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] due to the order of the inputs. The function does not handle the case where the maximum value comes first in the input list correctly, as it assumes the minimum value will always be the first element. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall implementation is not correct."
exp_3_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose as described in the docstring. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various cases, including empty lists and lists with mixed types, and the function returns the expected results in all cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of the given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various inputs, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_3_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is intended to find the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. However, the implementation starts the loop from n and includes n in the range, which causes it to return n instead of the largest divisor smaller than n. For example, calling largest_divisor(3) returns 3 instead of 1, which is incorrect. The loop should start from n-1 to ensure that the returned divisor is always smaller than n."
exp_3_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'factorize' function correctly computes the prime factors of the input integer 'n' and returns them in the expected order. The function handles both even and odd factors appropriately, and the provided test cases cover a variety of scenarios, all of which pass successfully. The output matches the expected results as described in the function's docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation incorrectly retains elements that appear only once. The test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) is expected to return [1, 4, 5], which is correct according to the description, but the implementation does not correctly handle the removal of duplicates. The logic used in the list comprehension does not account for the frequency of elements, leading to incorrect results."
exp_3_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly implements the behavior described in the docstring. It uses the 'swapcase' method to flip the case of each character in the input string, which is confirmed by the provided test assertions.

exp_3_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'concatenate' function correctly concatenates a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the behavior of the 'concatenate' function against the expected outputs, confirming that it handles both an empty list and a list of strings correctly."
exp_3_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings that start with the given prefix. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function do not fully validate the expected behavior of the function. Specifically, the second assertion expects the output to be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list and should only be included once in the output. Therefore, the test case does not match the expected output, leading to an incorrect evaluation."
exp_3_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function 'get_positive' correctly implements the logic to return only positive numbers from the input list. The list comprehension used in the function filters out non-positive numbers (i.e., numbers less than or equal to zero). The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the correctness of 'get_positive' against various scenarios, including lists with negative numbers, a mix of positive and negative numbers, an empty list, and a list with only negative numbers. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_3_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function is incorrect because it checks for factors from 2 to n-1. This is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results for larger numbers. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case for numbers that are prime but greater than 2, as it will check all numbers up to n, which is unnecessary. A more efficient approach would be to check for factors only up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for even numbers greater than 2 efficiently, as it checks all numbers up to n. The test cases provided in the 'check' function are correct, but the implementation fails to pass them for larger prime numbers due to inefficiency."
exp_3_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'find_zero' is intended to find a root of a polynomial defined by its coefficients, but it does not correctly implement a root-finding algorithm. The current implementation simply computes a value based on the coefficients without ensuring that it finds a root where poly(xs, x) = 0. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the 'find_zero' function, but they incorrectly reference 'poly' instead of 'find_zero'. This leads to a failure in the test as 'poly' does not return a root. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it appends the sorted value of the individual element 'l[i]' (which is incorrect). The correct approach should involve collecting all values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back at the respective indices in the new list. The test assertions will fail as a result of this incorrect logic."
exp_3_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list.

The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum element in the list is actually 124, not 123 as stated in the docstring. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed."
exp_3_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. However, the implementation only counts how many numbers contain the digit '7' without correctly handling the divisibility condition. For instance, the number 77 is divisible by both 11 and 13, but the function does not correctly account for all occurrences of '7' in such numbers. The test assertions indicate that the expected results are based on the correct interpretation of the problem, but the implementation fails to meet these expectations."
exp_3_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly implement the sorting of even indices while preserving the values at odd indices. The function sorts both even and odd indexed values, which is not the intended behavior. Additionally, it reverses both lists before combining them, which further deviates from the expected output.

exp_3_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing 'encode_cyclic' instead of 'decode_cyclic'. The assertion should compare the output of 'decode_cyclic' with the original string, not 'encode_cyclic'. This means that the test is not verifying the correctness of the decoding function, which is the intended purpose of the check."
exp_3_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prime_fib' is incorrect because it does not properly generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality. The function calls 'fib(n)' to get the n-th Fibonacci number, but it does not increment 'n' in the while loop to find the next Fibonacci number if the current one is not prime. As a result, it will repeatedly check the same Fibonacci number until it finds a prime, which is not the intended behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are no prime Fibonacci numbers for higher values of 'n'. The test assertions include values for n up to 10, which are expected to return the correct prime Fibonacci numbers, but the implementation will fail for these cases due to the reasons mentioned."
exp_3_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it only checks for the sum of three consecutive elements after sorting the list. This approach does not account for the requirement of finding any three distinct elements that sum to zero. For example, in the case of the input [2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7], the correct triplet (-5, 2, 3) sums to zero, but the current implementation would not find it since it only checks adjacent elements in the sorted list. A proper implementation should use a nested loop or a hash set to check all combinations of three distinct elements."
exp_3_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it contains only a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not produce any output or perform any calculations.

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2], but the correct output from 'incr_list' would be [4, 3, 2].

Therefore, while the function is correct, the test cases contain incorrect expected outputs."
exp_3_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function pairs_sum_to_zero is incorrect because it uses a recursive approach that checks for pairs by removing one element at a time and checking the rest of the list. This leads to incorrect results, especially for cases where the two elements that sum to zero are not adjacent. For example, in the test case pairs_sum_to_zero([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30]), the correct pairs are -3 and 3, but the function may not find them due to its flawed logic. A more efficient approach would be to use a set to track the complements of the numbers seen so far, which would allow for a direct check of whether the required pair exists."

The correct conversion should yield '100', but the implementation does not account for this, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the test case 'change_base(234, 2)' is expected to return '11101010', which is correct, but the function's logic does not guarantee that all conversions will be accurate for all inputs within the specified constraints."

The correct results for these cases should be 0 and 1 respectively, as 2^30 modulo 5 is 0 and 2^31 modulo 5 is 1. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all the provided test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the encode_shift function is incorrect because it does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet ('a' to 'z'). The decode_shift function is also incorrect for the same reason. Both functions assume that all input characters are lowercase letters, which leads to incorrect behavior when non-lowercase characters are present. Additionally, the check function is incorrectly testing encode_shift instead of decode_shift, as it is asserting that the encoded string can be decoded back to the original string using the same function."

The correct values for fibfib(10) and fibfib(12) should be 81 and 274 respectively, but the function does not return these values, indicating a logical error in the computation."
exp_3_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' does not correctly account for the condition that 'y' is only considered a vowel when it is at the end of the word. The current implementation counts 'y' as a vowel in all positions, which leads to incorrect results for test cases such as 'key' and 'bye'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly, as it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases provided also do not cover all edge cases, such as empty strings or strings without vowels."
exp_3_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits correctly. According to the function description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is greater than the length of the string representation of the number. The test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is '001', but the actual output is '100' since the function does not account for leading zeros. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' fails because the expected output is '79', but the actual output is '97' since the shift exceeds the number of digits. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the number of oranges is greater than 0 but not explicitly mentioned in the test cases. The test case 'assert candidate(""5 apples and 6 oranges"",21) == 10' is incorrect because it expects the function to return 10, but the function will return 21 - 5 - 6 = 10, which is correct. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""1 apples and 100 oranges"",120) == 19' is also misleading because it expects 19, but the function will return 120 - 1 - 100 = 19, which is correct. The function does not account for potential variations in the input string format, such as additional spaces or different word orders, which could lead to incorrect parsing. Therefore, while the logic of the function is mostly correct, the test cases do not comprehensively validate the function's robustness against various input formats."
exp_3_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' has a logical flaw in how it determines the index of the smallest even value. The current approach first finds the minimum even value and then uses 'even_values.index(min(even_values))' to find its index in the original array. This will fail if the smallest even value appears multiple times, as it will always return the index of the first occurrence in the 'even_values' list, which may not correspond to its index in the original array. For example, in the case of 'candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])', the function will return [0, 1], but the correct output should be [0, 1] since the first occurrence of 0 is at index 1. However, if the input were 'candidate([0, 0, 1])', it would incorrectly return the index of the first 0, which is correct, but if the input were 'candidate([2, 0, 2])', it would incorrectly return the index of the first 2 instead of the first 0. The function needs to be modified to track both the minimum even value and its index in a single pass through the array."

The function sorts the list and then checks each integer against hardcoded conditions, which does not account for the frequency of each integer in the list. The function should count the occurrences of each integer and then find the maximum integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. As a result, the function fails to return the correct values for many test cases, such as 'search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4])' which should return -1 but does not."
exp_3_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly achieve the desired 'strange sorting' as described in the comments. The sorting logic using 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x, -x))' does not alternate between the minimum and maximum values as required. Instead, it sorts the list in a regular order, which does not match the expected output for the provided test cases. For example, 'strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])' should return '[1, 4, 2, 3]', but the current implementation would return '[1, 2, 3, 4]'. Therefore, the function fails to satisfy the requirements outlined in the docstring."

The formula used, (a * b * c) / (4 * (a + b + c)), does not yield the correct area for a triangle given its side lengths. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its side lengths a, b, and c is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for the triangle with sides (1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433. Therefore, the function fails to produce the correct results for the provided test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly checks if the list q is balanced (palindromic) and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight w.

Instead, it only compares the lengths of the lists themselves. The function should sum the lengths of all strings in each list and then compare those sums to determine which list has fewer total characters. As a result, the function fails to return the correct list in cases where the total character counts are different but the list lengths are the same."
exp_3_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of three prime numbers. However, the current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as the product of two prime factors (i and a/i). It does not account for the requirement of three prime factors. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the product of three primes is needed, leading to incorrect results for inputs like 8, 10, and 125. The test cases also indicate that the function fails to return the expected results for several inputs, confirming that the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_3_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' is incorrect because it does not properly check if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. The condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to the way integer division and logarithmic calculations work. For example, for 'is_simple_power(9, 3)', the logarithm will yield a value that, when converted to an integer, does not accurately represent the power needed to reach 'x'. This results in incorrect evaluations for several test cases, such as 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True', which should return False. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 1 correctly, which can lead to further logical errors."
exp_3_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The function iscube(a) incorrectly checks if a is a perfect cube. The expression 'a**(1/3) == int(a**(1/3))' does not account for floating-point precision issues, which can lead to incorrect results for certain integers. For example, iscube(1729) should return False, but the test checks candidate(1728), which is not the same. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly since the cube root of a negative number is also negative, and the comparison with int() could fail due to precision errors."
exp_3_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'hex_key' is designed to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string. However, it does not correctly handle the input type as it assumes the input will always be a string. The test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is invalid because it passes an empty list instead of a string, which would lead to a TypeError when the function tries to iterate over it. Additionally, the function does not account for the prime digit 'A' (which is 10 in decimal) and incorrectly includes 'B' (11 in decimal) and 'D' (13 in decimal) as prime digits. The correct prime hexadecimal digits should be '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', and 'D', but the function is not designed to handle the input correctly in all cases."

exp_3_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for distinct characters among every three consecutive letters. The current logic only checks if three consecutive letters are the same, which is not sufficient to determine if they are distinct. For example, the string 'abc' would return True, but 'aab' would also return True, even though 'aab' contains non-distinct characters. The correct implementation should ensure that all three characters are distinct, which is not achieved in the current code."
exp_3_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values that fall on the boundary conditions. For example, the GPA of 3.0 should yield 'B+' according to the grading table, but the implementation incorrectly assigns 'B+' to any GPA greater than or equal to 3.0. Additionally, the GPA of 1.0 should yield 'D+' but the implementation incorrectly assigns 'D+' to any GPA greater than or equal to 1.0. The correct implementation should use '>' for all conditions except for the highest grade (4.0) and the lowest grade (0.0)."
exp_3_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' incorrectly identifies the length of the string 'orange' as not prime, returning False, which is correct. However, it fails to handle the case when the string length is 1 correctly, as 1 is not a prime number. The function should return False for strings of length 1. Additionally, the logic for checking prime numbers is flawed; it should check divisibility only up to the square root of the length, and it should also account for lengths less than 2. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_3_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' is not correctly counting the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The current implementation iterates through all n-digit integers and checks if they start or end with '1', which is inefficient and may lead to performance issues for larger n. Additionally, the expected results in the assertions are incorrect. For n=1, the only 1-digit number is '1', so the count is 1. For n=2, the valid numbers are 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, and 1, 21, ..., 91, which gives a total of 18. However, for n=3, the count should be 180, as there are 100 numbers starting with '1' (100-199) and 80 ending with '1' (101, 111, ..., 191, plus 201, 211, ..., 991). The function does not account for double counting numbers that both start and end with '1'. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer N, but it instead returns the binary representation of N itself.

However, for N = 150, the sum of its digits is 6, and the expected output is '110', but the function will return '10010110' (the binary representation of 150). Similarly, for N = 147, the sum of its digits is 12, and the expected output is '1100', but the function will return '10010011' (the binary representation of 147). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

However, the implementation currently sums the elements at even indices instead (using range(0, len(lst), 2)). This is a logical error in the index selection. For example, in the input [4, 2, 6, 7], the only even number at an odd index is 2, which is correctly returned as 2 in the example, but the implementation does not consistently apply this logic across all test cases. The assertions in the 'check' function do not align with the intended functionality of the 'add' function."
exp_3_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'anti_shuffle' does not correctly sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces. The current implementation uses 'sorted(s.split())', which sorts the list of words instead of sorting the characters within each individual word. For example, 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation would not achieve this as it does not sort the characters of 'Hello' and 'World!!!' separately."
exp_3_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates of each row by columns in descending order. After the first sorting by rows, the second sorting is done by columns in ascending order instead of descending order. This leads to incorrect results for cases where multiple occurrences of 'x' exist in the same row. For example, in the test case with the input [[1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,4,1,6], [1,2,3,4,5,1]], the expected output is [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)], but the implementation does not produce this result due to incorrect sorting logic."
exp_3_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' does not correctly handle the sorting logic based on the sum of the first and last elements of the array. Specifically, the conditions for checking whether the sum is even or odd are incorrectly implemented. The expression 'array[0] + array[n] % 2' does not group the addition correctly due to operator precedence, leading to incorrect evaluations. Additionally, the function does not sort the array as required; it simply returns the original array in cases where the sum is even. The function also has unnecessary repetitive code for different lengths of the array, which could be simplified. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_3_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encrypt' function does not correctly perform the encryption as described. The function is supposed to rotate the alphabet by two positions for each letter in the input string, but the current implementation does not achieve this. Instead, it creates a new alphabet string that is not used to map the input characters to their encrypted counterparts. The function lacks the logic to replace each character in the input string with the corresponding character from the new alphabet. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."

For example, in the case of next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected output is None, but the function incorrectly returns 1 because it sorts the list and returns the second element, which is still 1. Additionally, the case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -34, not -35, as -34 is the second smallest element. The function fails to account for duplicates and negative numbers correctly."
exp_3_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' only checks for sentences that are split by the '.' character. However, the problem statement specifies that sentences can also be delimited by '?' and '!'. As a result, the function will not correctly count sentences that start with 'I' if they are followed by these other delimiters. For example, the input 'I love this?

exp_3_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'any_int' does not correctly check if all three numbers are integers before evaluating the condition. The method 'is_integer()' is only called on 'x', and it will raise an AttributeError if 'x' is not a float.

For example, the vowel 'a' should be replaced with 'c', 'e' with 'g', 'i' with 'k', 'o' with 'q', and 'u' with 'w'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case swapping correctly, as it only converts the entire message to lowercase at the beginning.

The condition 'elif key.isupper() != key.islower()' will always evaluate to True for any string key, as a string cannot be both upper and lower case simultaneously. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the keys are mixed case or not strings. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the dictionary is empty, as it returns False as expected, but the logic for checking the case of the keys is flawed."
exp_3_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'count_up_to' is incorrect because it does not return the correct list of prime numbers less than 'n'. For example, 'count_up_to(6)' should return [2, 3, 5], but it incorrectly returns [2, 3, 5]. Additionally, the function is not designed to dynamically calculate prime numbers; instead, it uses hardcoded values for specific inputs, which limits its functionality and correctness for inputs not explicitly defined in the code.

However, for multiply(148, 412), the unit digits are 8 and 2, and their product is 16, which is also correct. The function fails for the assertion multiply(14, -15) where the unit digits are 4 and 5, and their product should be 20, which is correct. The assertion multiply(76, 67) should return 42, but the unit digits are 6 and 7, and their product is 42, which is correct. The function does not fail any of the tests, but the reasoning behind the expected outputs is not clearly defined in the comments.

For example, for the input (13, 12), it returns -1, which is correct, but for (11, 15), it would also incorrectly return -1 instead of 14.

The correct approach should involve checking the number of 'break points' in the array where the order is disrupted. Specifically, the function should count how many times the order decreases (i.e., arr[i] > arr[i+1]) and ensure that there is at most one such break point for the array to be sortable by right shifts.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case sensitivity correctly, as it converts the entire word to uppercase but does not check for lowercase vowels. The test case 'full' should return 'u' but it is incorrectly expected to return 'U', which indicates a misunderstanding of the case sensitivity requirement. Furthermore, the function fails to return the correct vowel in cases like 'Above', where the expected output is 'o'. Overall, the logic does not align with the function's description."

For example, the test case 'prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])' should return -10, but it incorrectly returns 10 due to the incorrect sign product calculation.

Additionally, the logic for checking the path length and returning the path is flawed. The path should be built based on the original grid values, and the algorithm should ensure that it explores all valid paths of length k while maintaining the lexicographical order.

Additionally, the expected outputs in the assertions include floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 8.0), which do not match the integer outputs of the function.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it will raise an error when trying to reduce an empty list. The correct approach would involve converting the characters back to integers before applying the modulo operation and checking for an empty list before performing the reduction."

For example, in the case of 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed not part of any word since it is separated by a space, and the function correctly returns True. However, in the case of 'apple pi e ', the function incorrectly returns False because it checks for the last character being a space, which is not the intended behavior. The function should instead check if the last character is an alphabetical character and ensure that it is followed by a space or is at the end of the string without any trailing spaces."

For example, the sum of the first 4 positive even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) is 20, but the function would return True for any even number greater than or equal to 8, which is incorrect. The test cases provided also include values like 10, 12, and 16, which should return True, but the function does not correctly validate the condition of being the sum of exactly 4 even numbers."

For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but the current implementation would return '_Example-3' only if it had been implemented correctly.

Additionally, the check for the file extension only verifies the last four characters, which could lead to incorrect results if the file name is longer than four characters and has a valid extension at the end. For example, 'this_is_valid.txt' should return 'Yes', but the implementation would incorrectly return 'No' for names like 'this_is_valid.txtexe'.

For example, the expected result for the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 0.6667 (2/3) and for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] it should be 1.0, which is correct, but the last assertion for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is incorrect as it expects 6.0/5.0 instead of the correct MAD value."
exp_4_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not handle the case where the input list has more than one element correctly. Specifically, when the input list has two or more elements, the function recursively calls itself, which leads to an incorrect result. For example, 'intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)' should return '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]', but the current implementation will return '[2, 2, 2, 2]', which is incorrect because it does not insert the delimiter between the elements correctly. The correct implementation should ensure that the delimiter is added between every two consecutive elements, which is not achieved in the current recursive approach."
exp_4_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group. The use of 'max(len(re.findall(r'\(', s)) - len(re.findall(r'\)', s))' is flawed as it only computes the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses, which does not reflect the actual depth of nesting. Instead, a proper approach would involve iterating through each character in the string and maintaining a counter for the current depth, updating the maximum depth encountered for each group. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_substring' is incorrect because it does not account for the case sensitivity of the substring search. The test cases provided in the 'check' function include strings that may not match due to case differences. For example, if the substring 'run' is searched in 'grunt', it should match, but if the substring were 'RUN', it would not match. The function should either convert both the strings and the substring to the same case (e.g., lower case) before checking for inclusion, or the test cases should be adjusted to ensure they only test for case-sensitive matches."
exp_4_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The use of 'reduce' from the 'functools' module is missing, which will lead to a NameError. Additionally, the product of an empty list should return 1, but the current implementation will raise an error when trying to compute the product of an empty list. The test cases also reveal that the product of the list [100, 0] should return 0, which is correctly handled, but the overall implementation fails for the empty list case."
exp_4_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list of integers. The implementation initializes an empty result list and iterates through the input numbers. For each number, it appends the maximum of the current number and the last appended maximum to the result list. The provided test assertions cover various scenarios, including an empty list, a strictly increasing list, a strictly decreasing list, and a list with varying values. All assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_4_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'is_palindrome' function instead of the 'make_palindrome' function. The assertions provided in the 'check' function do not correspond to the expected outputs of 'is_palindrome', which is supposed to return a boolean indicating whether the input string is a palindrome. Additionally, the implementation of 'make_palindrome' has a logical flaw: it does not correctly append the necessary characters to form the shortest palindrome. For example, 'make_palindrome('jerry')' should return 'jerryyj' instead of 'jerryrrej'. Therefore, the overall implementation is incorrect."
exp_4_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor does not handle cases where the input strings 'a' and 'b' are of different lengths. The test cases provided in the check function assume that both strings are of equal length, but the implementation does not enforce this. If the lengths of 'a' and 'b' differ, it will raise an IndexError when trying to access an index that does not exist in the shorter string. Therefore, the implementation is not robust and fails to meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_4_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the use of 'max' with the key 'len' will return the last occurrence of the longest string instead of the first one. For example, in the test case 'longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])', the expected output is 'yyy' since it is the first string with the maximum length of 3, but the function will return 'zzzz' instead."
exp_4_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function cover a variety of scenarios, including coprime numbers (3 and 7), a common divisor (10 and 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49 and 14), and a case with larger numbers (144 and 60). All assertions in the check function pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_4_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 0 to the length of the string (inclusive), correctly slicing the string to create each prefix. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness for various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements."
exp_4_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The return statement uses ''.join(...) which concatenates the numbers without any delimiter. To fix this, it should use ' '.join(...) to ensure that the numbers are space-delimited as specified in the function's docstring."
exp_4_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly counts distinct characters in a string while ignoring case. The implementation uses 'set' to collect unique characters after converting the string to lowercase, which aligns with the function's description. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness, including edge cases like an empty string and varying cases of characters."
exp_4_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `parse_music` does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical notation. Instead of returning a list of integers based on the notes in the input string, it returns a hardcoded list. The function fails to process the input string and does not account for the different note representations ('o', 'o|', and '.|'). Therefore, the function does not produce the expected output for the provided test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring within the string. The method used (replacing the substring and calculating the length difference) only counts non-overlapping instances. For example, in the case of 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', the expected count is 3 (the overlaps 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the implementation would return 2. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the docstring."
exp_4_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input string of number words. The sorting is done lexicographically (alphabetically) rather than numerically based on their values. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted words, which would lead to a concatenated string without spaces."
exp_4_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic only tracks the index of one of the closest elements but does not correctly identify the second closest element. Specifically, it returns 'numbers[min_diff_index]' and 'numbers[min_diff_index + 1]', which does not guarantee that the second number is the closest to the first. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the closest elements are 3.9 and 4.0, but the function would return 3.9 and 5.0 instead. The implementation needs to be revised to correctly identify and return the two closest numbers."
exp_4_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum values are the same. In such cases, the denominator (max_val - min_val) becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. For example, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because it assumes that the function will return [1.0, 0.0] when it should raise an error due to division by zero. Additionally, the expected output for 'assert candidate([2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0])' is incorrect; it should be [0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75] but the order of the inputs does not affect the output as expected. The function needs to be modified to handle cases where all numbers are the same."
exp_4_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance(value, int)' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test cases in the 'check' function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected, returning only the integers from the input lists. All assertions pass, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_4_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function.

exp_4_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' does not correctly implement the requirement to find the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n'. The loop starts from 'n' and checks for divisibility, but it returns 'n' itself when 'i' equals 'n', which violates the requirement of being smaller than 'n'. For example, calling 'largest_divisor(3)' should return 1, but the current implementation would return 3. The test cases in the 'check' function expect the correct behavior, but the implementation fails to meet this requirement."
exp_4_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'factorize' does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. The inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect results, especially for composite numbers. For example, when testing with 70, the expected output is [2, 5, 7], but the function will return [2, 5, 7] only if it finds the factors in that order. However, the implementation does not handle cases where multiple factors exist correctly, as it may skip over potential factors. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where a prime factor appears multiple times. The test cases provided in the 'check' function may pass for some inputs, but they will fail for others, indicating that the implementation is not robust."
exp_4_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation incorrectly retains elements that appear only once. The test case candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) is expected to return [1, 4, 5], which is correct, but the implementation fails to handle the case where elements are duplicated correctly. The logic used in the list comprehension does not account for the requirement to remove all duplicates, leading to incorrect results."
exp_4_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'swapcase()' effectively changes lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')) is expected to return ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA']. The implementation is correct, but the assertion in the test case is incorrect as it does not account for the fact that 'xxx' appears multiple times in the input list, and thus should only be included once in the output list."
exp_4_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function get_positive correctly implements the logic to filter out only positive numbers from the input list. The test assertions provided in the check function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various cases, including lists with negative numbers, a mix of positive and negative numbers, an empty list, and a list with only negative numbers. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_4_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for primality. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so we only need to check for factors up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for even numbers greater than 2 correctly, as it will return True for all even numbers greater than 2. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs, such as 4 and other even numbers."
exp_4_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The logic used to find the zero of the polynomial does not guarantee convergence to a root. The method used (Newton's method-like approach) is not properly defined, as it does not account for cases where the derivative (computed by the 'poly' function) could be zero, leading to division by zero errors. Additionally, the polynomial evaluation in the 'poly' function incorrectly uses 'xs[1]' twice in the polynomial expansion, which should be 'xs[2]' for the second term. This will lead to incorrect evaluations of the polynomial, affecting the root-finding process."
exp_4_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it attempts to sort the individual elements (which are integers) at those indices, resulting in an error. The correct approach should involve collecting the values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back into the new list at the appropriate indices while keeping the other values unchanged."
exp_4_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list.

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], but it incorrectly expects the result to be 124 instead of 124. Therefore, the test case fails, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation of the function."
exp_4_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' in those numbers. The test cases provided in the check function suggest that the expected outputs are based on the correct counting of '7's in the specified range, but the implementation does not correctly account for all numbers divisible by 11 or 13. For example, the number 77 (which is divisible by both 11 and 13) should contribute to the count, but the implementation does not correctly handle the counting logic for all relevant numbers. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for all test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly maintain the values at odd indices while sorting the values at even indices. The implementation concatenates the sorted even-indexed values with the odd-indexed values, which results in incorrect placements. For example, in the second test case, the expected output is [-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123], but the function returns [-12, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 11, 23, -10], which is incorrect. The odd-indexed values should remain in their original positions."
exp_4_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is incorrectly testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it is currently checking 'encode_cyclic(encoded_str)', which does not make sense. Therefore, the test will fail, and the implementation cannot be considered correct."
exp_4_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_fib' is expected to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation only returns the first two prime Fibonacci numbers (2 and 3) for n = 1 and n = 2, and for n >= 3, it incorrectly calls a function 'fibonacci(n)' which is not defined in the provided code. This will lead to an error when n is greater than 2. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime, so the logic to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number is not implemented correctly."
exp_4_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is not implemented correctly. It currently always returns False, which does not fulfill the requirement of checking for three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

exp_4_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it only contains a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any calculations or return any values. The expected output for the number of collisions, as indicated by the test assertions, suggests that the function should return n * n (the square of n), since each car moving left to right can collide with each car moving right to left. However, without an implementation, the function cannot produce any output, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect."

The expected output for this input should be [4, 3, 2], which is correct, but the assertion is misleading as it suggests the output is incorrect. Therefore, the overall correctness of the implementation is compromised by the incorrect test assertion."
exp_4_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it does not properly check for pairs that sum to zero. The recursive approach used in the code is flawed; it only checks pairs in a limited manner and does not consider all distinct pairs in the list. For example, in the case of the input [-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30], the function fails to find the pair (-3, 3) that sums to zero. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the list has more than two elements correctly, as it only checks the first element against the rest of the list recursively without considering all combinations.

Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(234, 2) == ""11101010""' is also incorrect; the correct binary representation of 234 is '11101010', which is correct, but the function does not handle the case of converting 9 to base 3 correctly.

The test cases also reveal this issue, as the assertion 'assert not candidate([1, 8, 4, 10], 10)' should return False, but the function would return True instead."

However, it fails for other cases such as [3, 2, 1] which should return [6, 2] but returns [2, 2]. Additionally, the case [3, 2, 1, 0, 4] should return [12, 6, 0, 0] but returns [2, 2, 0, 16]. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly handle all cases."

The base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2 return the expected values. The recursive case correctly computes the n-th FibFib number by summing the values of fibfib(n-1), fibfib(n-2), and fibfib(n-3). The provided test assertions in the check function also confirm that the implementation produces the correct outputs for the specified inputs."

The current implementation counts 'y' as a vowel regardless of its position. For example, 'key' should return 1 (not 2) because 'y' is at the end, but 'bye' should return 1 as well. Additionally, the function does not account for uppercase vowels, which means 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' should also be included in the count. The test cases provided do not cover all necessary scenarios, such as words with mixed case or words where 'y' is not at the end."

According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the string when the shift is greater than the length of the string, which is correct. The issue arises with the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""', which expects the output to be '001', but the function will return '00' instead. This is because the function does not pad the result with leading zeros. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."

The code assumes that the number of oranges is always at the same index (2) in the split string, which is not guaranteed. For example, in the test case '1 apples and 100 oranges', the number of oranges would be at index 4 after splitting, leading to an incorrect calculation. The function should be modified to correctly extract the number of oranges regardless of its position in the string."
exp_4_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly return the expected output. While it correctly identifies even values and their indices, the final return statement does not return the required format of [smallest_value, its index]. Instead, it returns only the first element of the sorted list, which is a list itself. The correct return should be a list containing the smallest even value and its index, not just the smallest even value. For example, the return statement should be 'return [sorted_even_values[0][0], sorted_even_values[0][1]]' instead of 'return sorted(even_values, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]'."

However, it returns the first valid integer found, which may not be the greatest one. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1, but the function returns 5, which is incorrect. The function needs to check all integers and keep track of the maximum valid integer before returning it."
exp_4_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly achieve the desired 'strange sorting' as described in the comments. The current implementation uses 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x%2)', which sorts the list based on whether the numbers are even or odd, rather than following the specified pattern of alternating between the minimum and maximum remaining values. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, such as 'strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])' returning [1, 2, 3, 4] instead of the expected [1, 4, 2, 3]. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the function description."

Additionally, the expected area values in the test cases do not match the results produced by the current implementation, indicating that the function does not return the correct area for valid triangles."

According to the function description, if the two lists have the same number of characters, it should return the first list. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' fails because the total character count for both lists is the same (8 characters each), but the function does not account for the case where the second list has a different composition of strings. The function should return the first list in this case, but it does not, leading to incorrect behavior."

The current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as a product of two prime factors, which is insufficient. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the product of three primes is required. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate(8) == True' is incorrect because 8 is not the product of three primes (it is 2 * 2 * 2). Furthermore, the assertion 'assert candidate(125) == True' is also incorrect as 125 is not the product of three primes (it is 5 * 5 * 5). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

The expression 'n ** int(math.log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to the way integer conversion is handled. For example, when 'x' is not an exact power of 'n', the logarithm may not yield an integer, leading to incorrect comparisons. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True' is incorrect because 9 is indeed 3 squared, but the implementation may not handle it correctly due to the integer conversion issue. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_4_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The function iscube(a) checks if a is a perfect cube by comparing a**(1/3) to int(a**(1/3)). However, this method can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. For example, while checking for perfect cubes, the result of a**(1/3) might not be exactly equal to int(a**(1/3)) due to rounding errors. This can cause the function to return False for some perfect cubes, such as 1728, which is a perfect cube (12^3) but would fail the test because of the precision issue. A more reliable approach would be to round the cube root and then cube it back to check if it equals the original number."

The function also does not count the prime hexadecimal digits as specified in the task description. The checks for hexadecimal validity are incorrect and excessive, and the actual counting logic for prime digits (2, 3, 5, 7, B, D) is missing entirely. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."

For example, the string 'abc' would pass the current check, but it should be evaluated for distinctness of every triplet, such as 'abc', 'bca', etc. The correct implementation should check if s[i], s[i + 1], and s[i + 2] are all different. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The grading logic incorrectly assigns 'D+' to any GPA greater than or equal to 1.0, which is not in line with the specified grading criteria. The correct output for a GPA of 1.2 should be 'D-', not 'D+'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' is incorrect as it should expect 'D-'. Therefore, the function fails to produce the correct letter grades for certain GPA inputs."

Specifically, it returns True for a string of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the logic used to check for prime numbers is flawed; it should check for factors up to the square root of the length of the string, rather than up to the length itself. This leads to incorrect results for strings of certain lengths, such as 'M' (length 1) and 'HI' (length 2). The assertions in the test cases reveal these issues, as some expected results do not match the actual output of the function."

However, the implementation counts incorrectly due to the way it checks each number in the range. The correct approach should consider the total counts of n-digit numbers starting with 1 and those ending with 1, while avoiding double counting the numbers that both start and end with 1."

However, for N = 150, the sum of the digits is 6, and the expected output is '110', but the function would return '10010110', which is the binary representation of 150.

The test cases provided in the 'check' function also do not align with the intended functionality, as they expect results based on the incorrect implementation. For example, 'add([4, 88])' should return 0 since there are no even elements at odd indices, but it returns 88 due to summing the element at index 1 instead."

The requirement states that the sorting should be based on the sum of the first and last elements of the array, but the code incorrectly checks if the sum of all elements is even or odd. This leads to incorrect sorting behavior for certain test cases, such as 'sort_array([21, 14, 23, 11])', which should return [23, 21, 14, 11] but will not due to the incorrect condition."

However, it does not account for characters outside the lowercase alphabet (e.g., uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters), which would lead to incorrect results for such inputs. Additionally, the test cases provided do not cover these edge cases, which could lead to further issues in real-world usage. Therefore, the implementation is not robust and does not meet the requirements as described."

Additionally, the case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -35 as the second smallest element, but the implementation does not account for the correct ordering of negative numbers.

Additionally, the type checks for integers are only applied when 'x' is being compared to the sum of 'y' and 'z', which means that if 'y' or 'z' are integers but 'x' is not, the function could incorrectly return True.

The problem statement specifies that the input should be an array of non-negative integers, but the test cases include negative integers. The expected outputs in the test cases do not match the actual outputs produced by the function. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]) == [-4, -2, -6, -5, -3]' is incorrect because the function does not account for negative numbers, and the expected output does not follow the sorting criteria based on the number of ones in their binary representation. Additionally, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is also incorrect as the actual output from the function would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which is correct, but the assertion in the test cases is wrong.

Firstly, the function does not correctly identify the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. The logic used to check for vowels and consonants is flawed. For example, in the case of 'FULL', the function returns 'u' instead of 'U', which is incorrect as it should be case-sensitive. Additionally, the loop that checks for vowels does not correctly iterate through the string to find the closest vowel between two consonants. The test cases also reveal that the function fails to return the expected results for several inputs, such as 'easy' and 'eAsy', which should return an empty string but do not. Overall, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, in the case of [4, -4, 4] with k = 2, the output is [4, 4], which is correct, but the function fails to sort the k elements in other cases.

The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the product by 1 for positive numbers and -1 for negative numbers without considering the count of negative numbers. This leads to incorrect results for test cases such as 'prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])' which should return -10 but does not due to the flawed logic in sign calculation."

The correct approach should involve iterating through the list to find the largest negative and smallest positive integers directly, rather than relying on sorting. This leads to incorrect results for several test cases, such as when there are multiple negative integers or when the smallest positive integer is not the first element in the sorted list."

The correct logic should ensure that if the total eaten (number + remaining) is less than the need, it should return the total eaten as 'number + remaining' and the remaining carrots as 0, indicating the rabbit is still hungry.

exp_5_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly for the product. The 'reduce' function is used with an initial value of 1, which is correct for the product of non-empty lists, but when the input list is empty, it should return 1 as specified in the function's docstring. However, the current implementation will raise a TypeError when trying to reduce an empty list without an initial value. The correct implementation should check if the list is empty and return (0, 1) directly in that case."
exp_5_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It iterates through the list and appends the maximum value found up to each index. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various scenarios, including an empty list, an increasing sequence, a decreasing sequence, and a mixed sequence. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_5_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' is correctly implemented and works as intended. However, the function 'make_palindrome' has a logical flaw. The algorithm does not correctly append the necessary characters to create the shortest palindrome. For example, the test case 'jerry' should return 'jerryrrej', but the implementation will not produce this result due to an incorrect handling of the palindromic suffix. The loop logic does not correctly identify the longest palindromic prefix and append the correct characters to form the shortest palindrome."
exp_5_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor is intended to perform a binary XOR operation on two strings of '0's and '1's. However, the implementation does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. For example, if 'a' is '010' and 'b' is '110', the function will only compare the first three characters, which is correct. But if the lengths differ, it will not yield the expected result. The test case candidate('111000', '101010') is expected to return '010010', but the function will throw an error if the lengths are not equal. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the longest function does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the max function will return the last occurrence of the maximum length string instead of the first one. For example, in the test case longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']), 'zzzz' is returned, but 'yyy' is the first string with the maximum length of 4. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test cases in the check function cover various scenarios, including coprime numbers (3 and 7), a common divisor (10 and 15), a case where one number is a multiple of the other (49 and 14), and a case with larger numbers (144 and 60). All assertions in the check function pass, confirming that the implementation is correct."
exp_5_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,False,INCORRECT,"The function all_prefixes is expected to return all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. However, the implementation returns an extra prefix, which is the empty string. The correct output for an empty input string should be an empty list, but the implementation includes the empty string as the first prefix. Therefore, the assertion for the empty string fails, leading to an incorrect implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The correct implementation should return a string with space-delimited numbers, but the current implementation uses ''.join() without a space separator, resulting in a concatenated string without spaces. For example, calling string_sequence(5) should return '0 1 2 3 4 5', but it currently returns '012345'."
exp_5_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_distinct_characters is intended to count distinct characters in a string regardless of case. However, the test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' should return 6 distinct characters ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') but it returns 5, indicating that the implementation does not correctly account for all distinct characters when they appear in different cases. The implementation is correct for other test cases, but this specific case reveals a flaw in handling character uniqueness."
exp_5_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_music' does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical note legend. Instead of dynamically generating a list of integers based on the input string, it returns a hardcoded list. This means that it will not produce the expected results for varying inputs, as demonstrated by the test assertions. The function needs to iterate through the input string, identify the notes based on the legend, and return the corresponding list of beats."
exp_5_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly count overlapping occurrences of the substring within the string. The current approach calculates the difference in length between the original string and the string after removing all occurrences of the substring. This method fails to account for overlapping cases, such as in the example 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', where the correct count should be 3 (the occurrences are at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3). A correct implementation would involve iterating through the string and checking for the substring at each position, allowing for overlaps."
exp_5_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the numbers represented as words. The sort method sorts the strings lexicographically (alphabetically), which does not correspond to their numerical values. For example, 'five' comes before 'four' when sorted alphabetically, which is incorrect. Additionally, there is a missing space in the return statement, which results in the output being concatenated without spaces. The function needs to map the words to their corresponding numerical values, sort them based on those values, and then convert them back to words before returning the result."
exp_5_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly return the closest elements. The logic used to find the closest pair only tracks the index of one of the closest numbers, but it does not correctly identify the second number. Specifically, it always returns the number at 'min_diff_index + 1', which may not be the closest number to the one at 'min_diff_index'. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])', the closest numbers are 3.9 and 4.0, but the function would return (3.9, 4.0) correctly in this case. However, in other cases, such as 'find_closest_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1])', it would return (2.2, 3.1) which is incorrect as 2.2 and 3.1 are not the closest pair. The function needs to store both numbers that are closest, not just one index."
exp_5_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is correct for the provided test cases, except for the second test case in the 'check' function. The assertion 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [1.0, 0.0] based on the linear transformation, but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] as expected. However, the order of the output is reversed, which is not consistent with the requirement that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. Therefore, the implementation does not handle cases where the input list is not sorted correctly, leading to incorrect results for some inputs."
exp_5_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension combined with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they cover various scenarios including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_5_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, and they all pass successfully. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_5_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' does not correctly implement the logic to find the largest divisor smaller than n. The loop starts from n and checks for divisibility, but it returns n itself when i equals n, which violates the requirement to find a divisor smaller than n. For example, calling largest_divisor(3) should return 1, but the current implementation would return 3 instead. The function needs to start checking from n-1 down to 1 to find the largest divisor smaller than n."
exp_5_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `factorize` function does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect factorization when n is divisible by a prime factor greater than 2. For example, when n is 70, the function will first find 2, then reduce n to 35, and then it will find 5, but it will not find 7 correctly because the outer loop continues with n = 7 and will not find any factors. This results in missing factors in the output. The function should instead iterate only up to the square root of n and handle the remaining n if it is greater than 1 after the loop. Additionally, the test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, such as prime numbers greater than 2 or composite numbers with multiple prime factors."
exp_5_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each unique element. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4] because 2 occurs more than once and should be removed entirely. The implementation does not achieve this, as it retains the first occurrence of 2. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirement."
exp_5_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'char.swapcase()' effectively converts lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function meets the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'concatenate' function correctly concatenates a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function confirm that the function behaves as expected for both an empty list and a list with multiple strings. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test assertion check(candidate) fails because the expected output for the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] with prefix 'xxx' is incorrectly specified. The correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list. The assertion does not account for duplicate entries in the output."
exp_5_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function get_positive correctly filters out only the positive numbers from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through the list and includes only those elements that are greater than zero. The provided test assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with negative numbers, a mix of positive and negative numbers, an empty list, and a list with only negative numbers. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_5_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for prime numbers. The loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. It should only check up to the square root of n for factors. This inefficiency can lead to performance issues for larger numbers. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of even numbers greater than 2 correctly, as it will return True for them, which is incorrect. Therefore, the function fails to pass the assertions correctly for all cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The logic used to find the zero of the polynomial does not correctly apply any root-finding algorithm. Instead, it simply computes a value based on the coefficients, which does not guarantee that poly(x) = 0. The test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the correctness of a root-finding function, but they are incorrectly checking against the 'poly' function instead of 'find_zero'. Therefore, the code does not fulfill the requirements of finding a zero of the polynomial."
exp_5_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' is incorrect because it does not sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead, it appends the original value at those indices and attempts to sort the value at non-divisible indices, which is not the intended behavior. The expected behavior is to collect the values at indices divisible by three, sort them, and then replace the original values at those indices in the output list. The test cases provided in the assertions also indicate that the output does not match the expected results."
exp_5_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from a list.

exp_5_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function max_element is correct, but the test case in the check function contains an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum value in the list is actually 124, but the original function's docstring example shows a different list with 123 as the maximum. Therefore, the test case does not match the expected output of the function as described in the docstring."
exp_5_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' correctly. The test assertions provided in the check function indicate that the expected results for inputs like 100, 200, 4000, and 10000 do not match the actual outputs of the function, suggesting that the logic for counting occurrences of '7' is not correctly aligned with the expected results. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function sort_even is intended to sort the values at even indices of the input list while leaving the values at odd indices unchanged. However, the implementation incorrectly sorts both even and odd indexed values, and then reverses them before combining. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases. For example, the expected output for the input [5, 6, 3, 4] is [3, 6, 5, 4], but the function will not produce this result due to the incorrect handling of odd indexed values."
exp_5_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it incorrectly checks 'encode_cyclic' instead. This leads to a failure in validating the decoding process. Additionally, the logic in both encoding and decoding functions is identical, which is incorrect. The decoding function should reverse the encoding operation, but it currently performs the same operation as encoding."

The implementation only handles the first two cases (n = 1 and n = 2) correctly, returning 2 and 3 respectively. For n >= 3, it calls a function 'fibonacci(n)', which is not defined in the provided code. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime.

However, the test assertions in the check function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the correctness of the implementation is incorrect due to the flawed test case."

This does not accommodate bases other than 2, which is a requirement based on the function's description. Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(9, 3) == ""100""' fails because the correct representation of 9 in base 3 is '100', but the function does not handle this conversion correctly.

The function sorts the even values and returns the first one, which is correct for finding the smallest even value, but it does not ensure that the index of that value is the smallest among those with the same value. For example, in the case of 'candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])', the function would return [0, 3] instead of the expected [0, 1], as it does not account for the index of the first occurrence of the smallest even value. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_5_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'search' does not correctly identify the greatest integer that meets the specified conditions. Specifically, the logic used to check the frequency of integers is flawed. The function only checks for the first occurrence of an integer that meets the frequency condition and returns it immediately, which may not be the greatest integer that satisfies the condition. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4])', the expected result is -1, but the function would return 4 because it checks the first integer that meets the condition without considering all integers in the list. Additionally, the sorting of the list is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the correct result. A more comprehensive approach is needed to evaluate all integers and their frequencies before determining the maximum valid integer."

The sorting key used in 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x, -x))' does not alternate between the minimum and maximum values as required. Instead, it sorts the list in a way that does not reflect the specified pattern. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4] should yield [1, 4, 2, 3], but the current implementation would not produce this result. The test cases provided in the 'check' function reveal that the output does not match the expected results for several cases, indicating that the sorting logic is flawed."
exp_5_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `triangle_area` does not correctly calculate the area of a triangle. The area of a triangle given its sides can be calculated using Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). The current implementation incorrectly uses the formula (a * b * c) ** (1/2), which does not yield the correct area. Additionally, the expected area for the test case `triangle_area(1, 1, 1)` is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the area calculated using Heron's formula would be sqrt(0.5 * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5)) = 0.433, which rounds to 0.43. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' fails because the total character count for both lists is equal (9 characters each). According to the function's description, in such cases, the first list should be returned, but the current implementation returns the second list instead. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where both lists have the same total character count."

The current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as a product of two prime factors, which is insufficient. Additionally, the function does not account for the requirement that the product must specifically involve three prime numbers. For example, the test case is_multiply_prime(8) should return False, as 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, which involves only one prime number. Furthermore, the test case is_multiply_prime(125) should return False, as 125 = 5 * 5 * 5, again involving only one prime number. The logic needs to be revised to ensure it checks for exactly three distinct prime factors."
exp_5_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The function `is_simple_power` is intended to determine if `x` is a simple power of `n`, meaning that there exists an integer `k` such that `n**k = x`. The implementation uses `math.log(x, n)` to find `k`, but it does not correctly handle cases where `x` is not an exact power of `n`. Specifically, the use of `int(math.log(x, n))` can lead to incorrect results due to flooring the logarithm, which may not yield the correct exponent if `x` is not a perfect power of `n`. For example, `is_simple_power(9, 3)` should return `True`, but it would return `False` because `int(math.log(9, 3))` evaluates to `2`, and `3**2` is `9`, which is correct. However, the function fails for other cases like `is_simple_power(24, 2)`, which should return `False`, but the logic does not account for the fact that `n` must be greater than `1` and `x` must be a non-negative integer. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that the function fails to satisfy, indicating that the implementation is not robust enough to handle all scenarios."

The expression 'a**(1/3) % 1 == 0' checks if the cube root of 'a' is an integer, but due to floating-point precision issues, this can yield incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the test checks 'candidate(1728)', which is not the same. Additionally, negative numbers should be handled correctly, but the current implementation may not accurately reflect this due to the same floating-point issues."

The correct prime hexadecimal digits to count are '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B' (11 in decimal), and 'D' (13 in decimal). Therefore, the function will return incorrect counts for inputs that contain 'D' or 'E'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is invalid since the input should be a string, not a list.

The current check only verifies if all three letters are the same, but it does not account for cases where the three letters are different. For example, the string 'abc' would be considered happy, but the implementation would not correctly validate this since it only checks for equality. The correct logic should ensure that s[i], s[i + 1], and s[i + 2] are all distinct. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Specifically, the condition for GPA 1.2 should return 'D-' instead of 'D+' as it falls between 1.0 and 1.3. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' is incorrect; it should be 'D-' based on the grading criteria. Therefore, the implementation fails to produce the correct letter grades for certain GPA values."
exp_5_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function incorrectly determines whether the length of a string is prime. Specifically, it returns True for strings of length 1, which is not a prime number. Additionally, it returns False for strings of length 2, which is a prime number. The logic for checking primality is also flawed; it should check divisibility only up to the square root of the length, and it should return True for lengths that are prime. The test cases reveal these issues, as some assertions fail due to the incorrect implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' is not correctly calculating the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The current implementation iterates through all n-digit integers and checks each one, which is inefficient and may lead to performance issues for larger n. Additionally, the expected results in the test assertions are incorrect. For n=2, the correct count should be 19 (10-19, 21-29, 31-39, ..., 91-99, plus 11), not 18. For n=3, it should be 198, not 180, and so on. The logic for counting should be based on combinatorial reasoning rather than brute force checking each number."

Similarly, for N = 150, the sum of the digits is 6, which should return '110', but the function returns '10010110' (the binary representation of 150). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

As a result, the output does not match the expected behavior described in the function's docstring and the provided test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates of the rows by columns in descending order. After the first sorting by rows, the second sorting is done incorrectly. The line 'result.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])' sorts the coordinates by the column index in ascending order instead of descending. This leads to incorrect output for cases where multiple occurrences of 'x' exist in the same row. For example, in the test case with input [[1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,4,1,6], [1,2,3,4,5,1]], the expected output is not achieved due to this sorting issue."

Instead of checking the sum of the first and last elements (array[0] + array[-1]), it incorrectly checks the sum of all elements in the array (sum(array)). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior for certain inputs. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of all elements is even, so it sorts in descending order, which is correct, but for an input like [1, 2, 3], the sum of the first and last elements (1 + 3 = 4) is even, and it would sort in descending order instead of ascending as required. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

The comments state that the letters should shift down by 'two multiplied to two places', which implies a shift of 4 positions. However, the code currently shifts each character by only 2 positions. For example, 'a' should become 'e' (not 'c'), and 'h' should become 'l' (not 'j'). Therefore, the test cases that expect a shift of 4 will fail, leading to incorrect outputs."

The current implementation sums all the first k elements without checking if they have at most two digits. Additionally, the function is overly complicated with repetitive code for each value of k, which could be simplified using a loop or list comprehension. The test cases also reveal that the function does not return the expected results for certain inputs, indicating that the logic is flawed."

However, the assertion for candidate(12) is incorrect as the odd numbers from the Collatz sequence for 12 are [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and the assertions are not entirely accurate."
exp_5_HumanEval/124,HumanEval/124,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `valid_date` does not correctly validate the number of days for each month and does not account for leap years. Specifically, it incorrectly checks the number of days for February (it allows up to 31 days) and does not differentiate between months with 30 and 31 days. Additionally, the year is not validated at all. The test cases that involve invalid dates based on the number of days in a month (like '04-31-3000' and '03-32-2011') would not be handled correctly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/125,HumanEval/125,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'split_words' contains a logical error in the first conditional check. The condition 'if '' in txt:' is always true because an empty string is considered to be present in any string. This means that the function will always attempt to split the input string on whitespace, regardless of whether any whitespace exists. Additionally, the function does not correctly count the number of lowercase letters in odd positions in the alphabet when neither whitespace nor commas are present. The correct implementation should check for whitespace and commas properly and count lowercase letters based on their positions in the alphabet."

The current implementation only checks if the list is sorted, without considering the number of duplicates. For example, is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) should return False according to the requirements, but it currently returns True because the list is sorted. Additionally, is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]) should also return False, but it currently returns True as well. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified criteria."

The function only checks if the intervals intersect and returns 'YES' if they do, without calculating the intersection length or checking for primality. For example, the intersection of (1, 2) and (2, 3) should yield a length of 0 (not prime), but the function incorrectly returns 'YES'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the intervals are the same, which should also return 'NO' as the length of the intersection is 0. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail."

The function is supposed to return the sum of the magnitudes of integers multiplied by the product of their signs. However, the current implementation only calculates the product of the signs and does not compute the sum of the magnitudes. For example, for the input [1, 2, 2, -4], the expected output is -9, but the function will return -1 (the product of signs) instead of the correct value. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include assertions that will fail due to this incorrect implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/129,HumanEval/129,False,INCORRECT,"The provided implementation of the function 'minPath' is incomplete and does not contain any logic to compute the minimum path of length k in the grid. The comments suggest a complex dynamic programming approach, but there is no actual code to perform the necessary calculations or return the required output. Therefore, it cannot produce the expected results as indicated in the test assertions."

Specifically, the recurrence relation for odd 'n' is incorrectly implemented. The function does not account for the correct calculation of 'tri(n)' for odd values, leading to incorrect results in the assertions. For example, 'tri(3)' should compute 'tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)', but the current implementation does not perform this calculation correctly. Additionally, the expected outputs in the assertions contain floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 8.0) which are not consistent with the expected integer outputs based on the provided sequence definition."

The expression 'i % 2 != 0' is applied to 'i', which is a string (character) representing a digit, rather than an integer. This will raise a TypeError when trying to perform the modulus operation. Additionally, the 'reduce' function is not imported, which will also cause a NameError. The function does not handle the case where all digits are even correctly, as it will return the product of the odd digits instead of 0. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_nested' incorrectly determines whether a string of brackets contains a valid nested subsequence. The current implementation only checks if the counts of '[' and ']' are equal, returning False if they are. This does not accurately assess nesting, as valid nested brackets can exist even if the counts are equal. For example, the input '[]' has equal counts but is not nested, while '[[]]' is nested but also has equal counts. The function fails to account for the actual structure of the brackets, leading to incorrect results for various test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' correctly computes the sum of the squares of the ceiling values of the elements in the input list.

The condition 'txt[-1] not in txt[:-1]' is intended to check if the last character is not part of any word, but it fails for cases where the last character is a letter followed by spaces. For example, in the case of 'apple pi e ', the last character is 'e', which is indeed part of a word, but the function incorrectly returns True. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/135,HumanEval/135,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'can_arrange' is not implemented, as it contains only a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any operations or return any values, which means it cannot produce the expected results for the test assertions provided in the 'check' function. Without a proper implementation, the function cannot fulfill the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. Specifically, the logic for finding the largest negative integer is flawed because it only updates 'a' if it finds a negative integer that is greater than the current value of 'a', which is not the intended behavior. The expected behavior is to find the largest negative integer, which should be the least negative (closest to zero). For example, in the case of [-1, -3, -5, -6], the function returns -1, which is correct, but in cases where there are multiple negative integers, it may not return the correct largest negative integer. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no positive integers correctly, as it should return None for 'b' in such cases. The test cases provided also indicate that the function fails to return the expected results for certain inputs."
exp_5_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle string representations of numbers correctly, especially when they contain commas or periods. For example, '2,3' should be interpreted as 2.3, but the current implementation compares the strings directly, which will not yield the correct numerical comparison. Additionally, the function does not convert strings to floats or integers before comparison, which is necessary to fulfill the requirements stated in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_equal_to_sum_even incorrectly calculates whether a number can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. The current implementation checks if n is equal to the sum of all even numbers up to n, which is not the correct logic. For example, the sum of the first four positive even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) is 20, and the function would return False for any n less than 20, even though numbers like 8, 10, and 12 can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers (e.g., 2+2+2+2, 2+2+2+4, 2+2+4+4 respectively). The test cases also indicate that the function does not handle all cases correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' does not correctly compute the Brazilian factorial as defined in the comments. The current implementation recursively multiplies 'n' by the result of 'special_factorial(n-1)', which computes the standard factorial (n!) instead of the Brazilian factorial (n! * (n-1)! * ... * 1!). The correct approach would involve calculating the factorial for each integer from n down to 1 and multiplying them together. Therefore, the test assertions will fail for inputs greater than 1."

The current implementation replaces all spaces with underscores first and then attempts to replace underscores with hyphens, which does not achieve the desired behavior. For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but the current implementation will not produce this result correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'file_name_check' does not correctly enforce the requirement of having no more than three digits in the file name. The first condition checks if the length of the file name is greater than 3, which is not the same as checking for the number of digits. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the substring before the dot is empty, as it only checks if the first character is a letter. The implementation also fails to check if the substring after the dot is valid when there are no digits in the file name. Therefore, the function does not meet all the specified conditions for a valid file name."
exp_5_HumanEval/142,HumanEval/142,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the comments. Specifically, the code squares the integer at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 3, but it does not correctly cube the integer at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The current implementation will square the integer at index 0 (which is a multiple of 3) and will also square any integer at indices that are multiples of 3, regardless of whether they are also multiples of 4. This leads to incorrect results for test cases where both conditions apply. For example, the test case '[-56,-99,1,0,-2]' should return 3030, but the current implementation will not produce the correct output due to the flawed logic."
exp_5_HumanEval/143,HumanEval/143,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify words with prime lengths. The implementation lacks the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is crucial for determining if a word's length is prime. Without this function, the filter will not work as intended, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the output for the test case 'here' should be an empty string, which is correct, but the other assertions may fail due to the missing prime-checking logic."
exp_5_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly evaluate whether the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality of cross products, which is not the correct approach to determine if the product of the fractions is a whole number. Instead, the function should check if (x_num * n_num) is divisible by (x_den * n_den). This means that the product of the numerators should be divisible by the product of the denominators for the result to be a whole number. As a result, the function will fail for some test cases, such as 'simplify(""1/5"", ""1/5"")', which should return True but will return False due to the incorrect logic."
exp_5_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'order_by_points' is not implemented, which means it cannot produce any output or fulfill the requirements stated in the docstring.

Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail, leading to incorrect behavior."
exp_5_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' does not correctly check the first digit of the number. The condition '(num // 10) % 2 == 1' only checks the second digit for oddness, not the first digit. For example, the number 21 would pass the check incorrectly since its first digit (2) is even. The correct approach would involve extracting the first digit properly, which can be done by converting the number to a string or using a loop to divide by 10 until the first digit is found."
exp_5_HumanEval/147,HumanEval/147,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation does not correctly follow the problem requirements. The function is supposed to count the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) such that their sum is a multiple of 3, but the code only counts pairs (a[i], a[j]) whose sum is a multiple of 3. Additionally, the array 'a' is incorrectly initialized as a list of integers from 1 to n instead of using the formula a[i] = i * i - i + 1. This leads to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/148,HumanEval/148,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'bf' does not correctly implement the logic to find planets between the two given planets. The slicing operation 'planets[planet1:planet2]' is incorrect because it assumes 'planets' is a list or similar structure that supports slicing by planet names, which it is not. Instead, 'planets' should be a list of planet names in order, and the function should find the indices of 'planet1' and 'planet2' to correctly slice the list. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where 'planet1' is after 'planet2' in the list, which could lead to incorrect results or an empty tuple when it should return the planets in between. The test cases also include a case where the order of planets is reversed, which the current implementation does not handle."
exp_5_HumanEval/150,HumanEval/150,False,INCORRECT,"The function x_or_y is supposed to return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. However, the implementation incorrectly checks if n is even (n % 2 == 0) to determine the return value. This logic does not correctly identify prime numbers, as many prime numbers (e.g., 3, 5, 7) are odd, and the number 2 is the only even prime. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct values for prime numbers and non-prime numbers, leading to incorrect results for the provided test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/151,HumanEval/151,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'double_the_difference' does not correctly handle the requirements specified in the docstring. The function is supposed to return the sum of squares of odd integers only, while ignoring negative numbers and non-integers. However, the list comprehension used in the function only checks if a number is odd (i%2==1) and does not filter out negative numbers or non-integers. As a result, the function will incorrectly include negative odd numbers in the calculation. For example, the test case 'double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0])' should return 0, but the current implementation will not handle this correctly. Additionally, the test case 'double_the_difference([0.2, 3, 5])' is expected to return 34, but the function will not correctly process the non-integer 0.2, leading to incorrect results."

The function currently returns the absolute difference for each index, but it does not account for the case where the guess is correct (i.e., the difference should be 0). The expected output for the test cases indicates that if the guess matches the score, the result should be 0, which is not handled correctly in the code. For example, in the test case compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]), the expected output is [0,0,0,0,3,3], but the function would return [0,0,0,0,3,3] as expected. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where the guess is negative or does not match the score correctly. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The strength should be calculated as CAP - SM, where CAP is the count of uppercase letters and SM is the count of lowercase letters. However, the current implementation only counts uppercase letters as positive and lowercase letters as negative, without properly tracking the counts of uppercase and lowercase letters separately. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are multiple extensions with the same strength correctly, as it only updates the strongest extension when a strictly greater strength is found, ignoring the case of ties. This leads to incorrect results for some test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/155,HumanEval/155,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case of negative numbers and the digit '0'. When the input is negative, the '-' sign is included in the string representation of the number, which causes the function to attempt to convert it to an integer, leading to an error. Additionally, the digit '0' should be counted as an even digit, but the function does not account for it correctly in the assertions. For example, the assertion for 'check(candidate(0))' is correct, but the function does not explicitly handle the case of '0' in the loop. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."

Specifically, when 'number + need' exceeds 'remaining', the function returns '[remaining, 0]', which is correct for the total eaten carrots but does not account for the fact that the rabbit is still hungry. The correct total should be 'number + remaining' instead of just 'remaining'. For example, in the case of 'eat(2, 11, 5)', the rabbit has eaten 2 carrots and needs 11, but can only eat 5 remaining carrots, so the total eaten should be 2 + 5 = 7, and the remaining should be 0.

For example, in the case of the input ['**', '*', '+'] and [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is 2 ** 3 * 4 + 5, which evaluates to 37. However, the current implementation will not yield the correct result due to the lack of proper handling of operator precedence. Additionally, the implementation does not correctly initialize the result for operations like multiplication and division, which can lead to incorrect results when the first operand is not 0. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Additionally, the recursive call does not ensure that only even numbers are included in the result. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 14)' should return an empty list, but the logic does not account for the range correctly. The test cases also include assertions that are not valid based on the function's intended behavior, such as 'assert candidate(10, 2) == [2, 4, 6, 8]', which should not return those values since there are no even numbers between 10 and 2."

Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

Therefore, the test case for an empty string fails, leading to an incorrect implementation."

The method used (subtracting the length of the modified string from the original string) only counts non-overlapping occurrences. For example, in the case of 'aaaa' and 'aa', the expected count is 3 (for 'aa' at indices 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3), but the current implementation would return 2. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1])', the closest elements are 2.2 and 3.1, which is also correctly returned. The issue arises because the function only checks adjacent elements, which can lead to missing the closest pair if they are not next to each other.

However, the assertion 'assert candidate([2.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0]) == [0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]' is also incorrect because the expected output is not matching the actual output.

The expected output for prime numbers should be 1, but the function will incorrectly return the prime number itself. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."

exp_6_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for prime numbers. The loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. Instead, it should only check up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function incorrectly identifies 13441 as a prime number, as it is actually not prime (it is 11 * 1223). This discrepancy is evident in the test assertions, where the assertion for candidate(13441) should return False, but it currently returns True."
exp_6_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `poly` function contains an error in the comment and the actual computation. The comment states that the polynomial should be evaluated as 'xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n', but the code actually uses 'xs[1] * x^2' instead of 'xs[2] * x^2' for the second coefficient. This leads to incorrect polynomial evaluation. Additionally, the `find_zero` function's logic for finding the zero of the polynomial is flawed and may not converge correctly, especially for polynomials of higher degrees. The test assertions in the `check` function are designed to validate the `find_zero` function, but since `poly` is incorrectly implemented, the results will not be reliable."
exp_6_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly handle the sorting of values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it attempts to sort the individual elements (which are integers) and appends them directly to the new list. This results in incorrect outputs. For example, in the case of the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the function will not produce this result. The correct approach should involve collecting the values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back into their respective positions in the new list."

The purpose of the check is to verify that the decoding function correctly reverses the encoding process. Therefore, it should call 'decode_cyclic' with the encoded string and assert that it returns the original string. Additionally, the test does not account for the fact that the encoded string may not match the original string if the encoding is not reversible, which is a potential issue with the implementation."

exp_6_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' does not correctly identify all combinations of three distinct elements that sum to zero. The current logic only checks consecutive elements after sorting the list, which means it will miss valid combinations that are not adjacent. For example, in the list [1, 3, -2, 1], the valid triplet is (1, -2, 1), but the function will not find it because it only checks (1, 3, -2) and (3, -2, 1). A correct approach would involve checking all combinations of three distinct elements, which can be achieved using nested loops or combinations from the itertools module."

For example, in the test case pairs_sum_to_zero([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30]), the correct pair (-3, 3) sums to zero, but the function will not find it because it only checks adjacent elements. A correct implementation should check for all possible pairs of distinct elements in the list."

Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(16, 2) == ""10000""' is also incorrect because the base-2 representation of 16 is '10000', which is correct, but the function does not support numbers greater than 9 in base conversion as per the docstring.

This discrepancy indicates that the function does not produce the correct median for this input. Additionally, the median of the sorted list [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000] should indeed be (6 + 10) / 2 = 8.0, which is what the assertion checks for, but it contradicts the function's comment that states the expected output should be 15.0.

Additionally, the test case 'acBAA' should return 'cB', but the function will return 'cBAA'. The function also does not handle the case where the input string contains mixed case vowels correctly, as seen in the test case 'EcBOO', which should return 'cB' but will return 'cBOO'.

It will always return the index of the first occurrence in the 'even_values' list, which may not correspond to its index in the original array. For example, in the case of 'candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])', the smallest even value is 0, which appears at indices 1 and 3 in the original array.

Additionally, the expected area for the test case triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should return approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433.

For example, the function does not correctly handle cases where elements need to be changed in a more complex manner than what is accounted for in the hardcoded conditions.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where the product of three primes includes repeated primes (e.g., 2 * 2 * 3 = 12). The test cases also reveal inconsistencies, such as is_multiply_prime(8) returning True, which is incorrect since 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, and does not involve three distinct primes. Furthermore, the check for a number greater than or equal to 100 is not implemented, as the function only checks if 'a' is less than 100 but does not restrict the input accordingly."

The use of 'int(log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues, especially when x is not an exact power of n. For example, 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' should return True, but it may not due to the way logarithms are calculated. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that contradict the definition of a simple power (e.g., 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True' is incorrect as 9 is not a power of 3). Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."
exp_6_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it does not properly check if the cube root of 'a' is an integer.

For example, 'iscube(-8)' would return False instead of True, as the cube root of -8 is -2, which is an integer. A more reliable approach would be to calculate the cube of the rounded cube root and compare it to 'a'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect; it should be 'assert candidate(1728) == True' since 1728 is a perfect cube (12^3)."

The function should iterate through the characters of the input string, check if each character is one of the specified prime hexadecimal digits, and maintain a count of such digits. The test cases provided in the `check` function may also fail due to the incomplete implementation of the counting logic."

For example, the string 'abc' would incorrectly return True, but it should return True since all characters are distinct. However, the string 'aab' would incorrectly return True as well, but it should return False since 'a' is repeated. The correct check should ensure that s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] are all distinct."

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case of strings with lengths that are not prime, as it only checks divisibility up to the length of the string, which can lead to incorrect results for certain lengths. For example, it will return True for a string of length 4 (which is not prime) because it does not check the divisibility by 2 correctly. The test cases also include strings of length 0 and 1, which are not handled correctly."

Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions are incorrect. For example, for n=2, the valid numbers are 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, 21, ..., 91, 01, which totals to 18, but the logic does not correctly account for all valid cases.

The current implementation uses 'sorted(s.split())', which sorts the list of words (not the characters within each word) and joins them without spaces. This leads to incorrect outputs for cases like 'Hello World!!!', where the characters in 'Hello' and 'World!!!' should be sorted individually, but the function instead sorts the words as a whole. The expected output for 'Hello World!!!' should be 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the function does not produce this result."

The docstring specifies that the letters should shift down by 'two multiplied to two places', which implies a shift of 4 positions (2 * 2). However, the implementation correctly shifts letters by 4 positions. The issue arises with the test cases provided. For example, the test case 'faewfawefaewg' should return 'jeiajeaijeiak', but the actual output from the function does not match this expected output. Therefore, the function does not pass all the assertions, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."

Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the smallest element appears multiple times. For example, in the case of next_smallest([1, 1]), it correctly returns None, but in the case of next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), it incorrectly returns 1 instead of None, as there is no distinct second smallest element. Additionally, the function does not account for cases where all elements are the same or where there are fewer than two unique elements. The sorting approach is not sufficient to ensure the correct second smallest value is returned."

Therefore, it fails to account for all possible cases where one number could be the sum of the other two. Additionally, the type check for integers is only performed if 'x' is the sum of 'y' and 'z', which means that if 'x' is not the sum, the function could return True incorrectly if 'x' is an integer and 'y' and 'z' are not. The test cases also include scenarios that would not be handled correctly by the current implementation."

For example, 'a' should be replaced with 'c' and 'A' with 'C', but the current implementation does not swap the case correctly for the vowels. Additionally, the output for the test case 'TEST' should be 'tGst' instead of 'tgst', as the 'E' should be replaced with 'G' and the case of 'T' should be swapped.

The filtering approach is inefficient and incorrect, as it does not account for all possible prime numbers and does not return the correct largest prime. Additionally, the function does not compute the sum of the digits of the largest prime found. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will likely fail."

Specifically, the nested loops that check for upper and lower case keys are flawed. The function should first determine if all keys are either lower case or upper case, but the current implementation incorrectly checks each key multiple times and does not properly handle the case where both types of keys exist. Additionally, the check for an empty dictionary is redundant since the first 'if not dict' already handles that case.

For example, the output for 'count_up_to(6)' should be [2, 3, 5] but the hardcoded value is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where n is greater than 24, as it is incomplete and cuts off at 'elif n == 24:'.

This behavior contradicts the requirement to round away from zero in such cases."

Similarly, when n is odd, it calls 'make_a_pile(n-2)', which also leads to incorrect results. The correct approach should involve maintaining the sequence of odd or even numbers based on the initial value of n, rather than decrementing n by 1 or 2. Therefore, the test assertions will fail for certain cases."

For example, rounded_avg(1, 5) should return '0b11' (which is correct), but rounded_avg(7, 13) should return '0b1011' instead of '0b1010' because the average of integers from 7 to 13 is 10.

Secondly, the repeated lines of code that convert integers to strings are excessive and unnecessary.

However, the current implementation only calculates the product of the signs and does not compute the sum of the magnitudes. For example, for the input [1, 2, 2, -4], the expected output is -9, but the function will return -1 (the product of signs) instead of the correct value. Additionally, the test case assertions include checks that expect the function to return specific values based on the described behavior, which the current implementation does not satisfy."

The function is incomplete as it lacks the implementation of the 'shortestPath' function, which is crucial for finding the correct path. Additionally, the logic for determining the minimum path based on lexicographical order is not present. The test cases provided in the check function may not yield the expected results due to these issues, particularly since the pathfinding logic is not implemented."

The recurrence relation for odd n is incorrectly defined in the code. The function only returns a static list for n = 0, 1, and 2, and does not properly handle the case for n > 2. Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions do not match the expected values based on the provided recurrence relations. For example, tri(3) should compute based on tri(2), tri(1), and tri(4), but the current implementation does not calculate tri(4) correctly, leading to incorrect results in the assertions."

The expression 'i for i in str(n) if i%2!= 0' attempts to filter odd digits, but 'i' is a string character, and the modulo operation cannot be applied directly to strings. This will raise a TypeError. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it will attempt to compute the product of an empty list, which will also raise an error. The correct approach should convert the characters back to integers before applying the modulo operation and handle the case of no odd digits returning 0."

The current implementation only checks if the number of opening and closing brackets are equal, which does not guarantee that the brackets are nested correctly. For example, the input '[][]' has equal counts but is not nested, while '[[]]' is nested and should return True. The function fails to account for the structure of the brackets, leading to incorrect results for several test cases."

The ceiling function for negative numbers will round towards zero, which is not the intended behavior for squaring. For example, -2.4 should round to -2, and squaring it gives 4, but the expected behavior is to round it to -2 and then square it, resulting in a positive value. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases involving negative numbers."
exp_6_HumanEval/134,HumanEval/134,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter is incorrect because it does not properly check if the last character is not part of a word.

Specifically, the logic for finding the largest negative integer is flawed; it should track the maximum of negative integers, but it incorrectly initializes 'a' to None and does not update it correctly when a larger negative integer is found. For example, in the test case 'largest_smallest_integers([-1, -3, -5, -6])', the expected output is (-1, None), but the function would return (-1, None) correctly. However, in cases where there are multiple negative integers, it fails to return the correct largest negative integer. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no positive integers correctly, as it should return None for 'b' when there are no positive integers, which it does, but the logic is convoluted and can lead to errors in other scenarios."

The current implementation only calculates the regular factorial (n!) recursively, rather than the product of all factorials from n down to 1. The expected output for special_factorial(4) is 288, which is the product of 4! (24), 3! (6), 2! (2), and 1! (1), but the function only returns 24 for n=4.

Specifically, it fails to check the number of digits in the file name. The first condition states that there should not be more than three digits in the file's name, but the code does not implement this check. Additionally, the first condition checks if the length of the file name is greater than 3, which is incorrect. The length check should not be based solely on the total length of the file name but rather on the number of digits present. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return 'Yes' for file names that contain more than three digits, leading to incorrect results for several test cases."

Specifically, the condition for cubing (i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0) is checked after the squaring condition (i % 3 == 0), which means that if an index is a multiple of 3, it will be squared and not checked for cubing. This leads to incorrect results for indices that are multiples of both 3 and 4. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030' is expected to fail because the function does not correctly compute the sum based on the specified rules. The function should first check if an index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3 before checking for multiples of 3."

For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, so it should not return anything for the input 'here'. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' is correct, but the function fails to account for other words correctly. The function also fails to return correct results for words like 'Hi' (length 2, prime) and 'Hussein' (length 7, prime) in the test case 'Hi I am Hussein', as it incorrectly returns 'Hi am Hussein' instead of 'Hi Hussein'. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The sort function in Python is stable, meaning it preserves the order of records that have the same key. However, the current implementation does not consider the index of the elements in the original list when there are ties in the sum of digits. The function should use a tuple as the key for sorting, which includes both the sum of digits and the original index of the element to ensure the correct ordering. This is evident from the test cases where the expected output does not match the actual output for certain inputs."
exp_6_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' does not correctly check the first digit of the number. The condition '(num // 10) % 2 == 1' only checks the second-to-last digit for oddness, rather than the first digit. For example, the number 15 would pass the check for the last digit being odd, but the first digit (1) is also odd, which is correct. However, for a number like 21, it would incorrectly count it as valid since the first digit (2) is even. Therefore, the function fails to accurately count numbers where both the first and last digits are odd."

The slicing operation 'planets[planet1:planet2]' is incorrect because it assumes 'planets' is a list or similar structure that supports slicing by names, which it is not. Additionally, the order of the planets is not considered, as the function does not handle the case where 'planet1' is further from the sun than 'planet2'. The function should first determine the indices of the planets in a predefined list and then return the planets between those indices. Furthermore, the test cases include assertions that would fail due to the incorrect implementation."

For example, in the test case 'assert candidate(['school', 'AI', 'asdf', 'b'])', the expected output is ['AI', 'asdf', 'school'], but the function will return ['AI', 'school', 'asdf'] because it only sorts by length. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' is incorrect as the function should handle varying lengths.

For example, the number 3 is prime but would return 'y' (the second argument) due to the current implementation. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of 'n' being less than 2, which is not prime. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements as described in the comments."

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where two extensions have the same strength; it should return the first one in the list, but the current logic does not ensure this. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

For example, the test case 'cycpattern_check(""abab"",""baa"")' should return True, but the current implementation would not find 'baa' or any of its rotations in 'abab'. Additionally, the return statement inside the loop will prematurely exit after the first iteration, which is incorrect. The function needs to generate all rotations of 'b' and check each one against 'a'."

In such cases, the function should return the total eaten carrots as number + remaining and the remaining carrots as 0, which is correctly done in the else clause. However, the first return statement incorrectly calculates the number of carrots left after meals, which should be the remaining carrots minus the difference between total eaten and need, not the need itself.

However, the current implementation evaluates the operations strictly from left to right without considering precedence, which can yield incorrect results. Additionally, the use of floor division (//) and exponentiation (**) may lead to unexpected results if not handled properly.

Instead, it has a series of conditional statements that return the first and third elements of the list for any length greater than two, which does not fulfill the requirement of finding the closest pair. The test cases provided in the 'check' function would fail because the function does not compute the closest elements based on their values, leading to incorrect results."
exp_7_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function rescale_to_unit is intended to rescale a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output is not valid. The function should return [1.0, 0.0] for the input [100.0, 49.9], but the implementation will return [1.0, 0.0] as expected. The test case is incorrectly asserting the order of the output, which should be [0.0, 1.0] for the input [49.9, 100.0]. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases contain an error."
exp_7_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance(value, int)' to check for integers, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various cases including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_7_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function.

Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_7_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' is intended to find the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n'. However, the implementation starts the loop from 'n' and checks for divisibility, which will always return 'n' itself on the first iteration. The loop should start from 'n-1' to ensure that the returned divisor is smaller than 'n'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."
exp_7_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the factorize function does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect factorization. For example, when factorizing 70, the function will return [2, 5, 7] correctly, but for other numbers like 18, it will not return [2, 3, 3] as expected. The function also does not handle cases where a number has repeated prime factors correctly, as it may skip some factors. The test cases provided in the check function will fail for certain inputs, indicating that the implementation is not robust and does not adhere to the expected behavior described in the docstring."
exp_7_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence. This means that if an element appears multiple times, it will not be included in the result at all. For example, in the test case candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output is [1, 4, 5], but the implementation will return [1, 2, 4, 5] because it only checks for the presence of the number in the result list and does not account for how many times it appears in the input list."

However, the test assertion check(candidate) includes a case where the expected output for the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] with prefix 'xxx' is ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], which is incorrect. The correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list. The function does not account for duplicate entries in the output, which leads to a mismatch with the expected results."
exp_7_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is supposed to return only positive numbers from the input list.

However, the first test assertion is incorrect because it expects [4, 5, 6] but the function returns [4, 5, 6] which is correct. The function is correct in its implementation but the test cases are misleading. Therefore, the evaluation is INCORRECT."
exp_7_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for prime numbers. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so it suffices to check for factors up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of n being 0 or negative correctly, as it should return False for these values. The test cases provided in the check function are mostly correct, but the implementation will fail for larger prime numbers due to inefficiency."
exp_7_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'find_zero' is intended to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in 'xs'. However, the implementation of 'find_zero' is flawed. The logic used to calculate 'x' does not correctly find the root of the polynomial. The method of summing the negative ratios of coefficients does not guarantee convergence to a root. Additionally, the test function 'check' is incorrectly testing 'poly' instead of 'find_zero', which means it does not validate the correctness of the root-finding logic. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. The function first appends the values at indices divisible by three to 'l_new', sorts 'l_new', and then appends the values at indices 1 and 2, which results in an incorrect output. The correct approach should involve sorting only the values at indices divisible by three and then reconstructing the list with those sorted values in their respective positions. The provided test cases also indicate that the output does not match the expected results."
exp_7_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to remove duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the resulting unique elements. The provided test assertion confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given input.
exp_7_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct, but the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10] and expects 124, but the actual maximum is 124, which is correct. However, the original example in the docstring of the function shows the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] as 123, which is also correct. The issue arises from the fact that the assertion in the check function is testing for a different value than what is expected based on the original function's docstring. Therefore, while the function works correctly, the test case is misleading and incorrect."
exp_7_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is supposed to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' correctly. The test cases provided in the check function, particularly for larger values of n, suggest that the expected counts of '7's are incorrect. The function does not return the correct counts for the test cases, indicating that the logic for counting occurrences of '7' is flawed or the expected results in the test cases are incorrect."

However, the implementation incorrectly sorts both even and odd indexed values and then combines them, which does not meet the requirements stated in the function's docstring. For example, in the test case sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]), the expected output is [3, 6, 5, 4], but the function would return [3, 4, 5, 6], which is incorrect."
exp_7_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should verify that decoding the encoded string returns the original string, which means it should call 'decode_cyclic' instead of 'encode_cyclic'. Therefore, the test will always fail, leading to an incorrect evaluation of the encoding and decoding process."
exp_7_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is not correctly implemented to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. The provided implementation only returns the first two prime Fibonacci numbers (2 and 3) for n=1 and n=2, respectively, and for n > 2, it incorrectly calls a function 'fibonacci(n)' which is not defined in the provided code. This will lead to an error when n is greater than 2. The expected outputs for n=6, n=7, n=8, n=9, and n=10 are also not handled correctly as the function does not compute the Fibonacci sequence or check for primality beyond the first two cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it only checks for the sum of three consecutive elements in the sorted list. This approach does not account for the possibility of non-consecutive elements that could also sum to zero. For example, in the list [1, 3, -2, 1], the elements 1, -2, and 1 (which are not consecutive) sum to zero, but the current implementation would not find this combination. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirement of finding any three distinct elements that sum to zero."
exp_7_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it contains only a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any calculations or return any values. The expected output for the test cases suggests that the function should return n * n (the square of n), which indicates the number of collisions between the two sets of cars. However, since the function is not implemented, it cannot produce any output, leading to a failure in all assertions in the 'check' function."

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2], but the correct output from 'incr_list([3, 2, 1])' is [4, 3, 2]. The assertion is actually correct, but the reasoning for the evaluation is based on the assumption that the test cases should match the expected output from the function, which they do not. Therefore, the overall evaluation is incorrect due to the mismatch in expected outputs in the test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,True,CORRECT,"The function pairs_sum_to_zero correctly implements the logic to check for two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. It first checks if the list has fewer than two elements, returning False if so. Then, it uses a nested loop to check all pairs of elements.

exp_7_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'change_base' is correct for converting numbers to bases between 2 and 10. However, the test cases in the 'check' function include an assertion 'assert candidate(9, 3) == ""100""', which is incorrect because the base 3 representation of 9 is '1000', not '100'. Therefore, the function fails to pass all the test assertions, indicating that the implementation is not fully correct."

Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is mostly correct, but the second test assertion in the check function is incorrect. The expected median for the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] should be 15.0, but the implementation returns 8.0. This discrepancy indicates that the code does not correctly compute the median for this specific input, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation."

The decode_shift function also has a similar issue. Both functions assume that the input string consists only of lowercase letters, which is not guaranteed. Additionally, the decode_shift function is incorrectly using the encode_shift function in the check function, which should instead call decode_shift to verify the decoding process. Therefore, the tests will fail for any input that includes uppercase letters, digits, or special characters."

However, the test case 'acBAA' is expected to return 'cB', but the implementation would return 'cB' as well, which is also correct. The test case 'EcBOO' is expected to return 'cB', but the implementation would return 'cB' as well, which is correct. The test case 'ybcd' is expected to return 'ybcd', and the implementation would return 'ybcd' as well, which is correct. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases are not comprehensive enough to cover all edge cases.

The test cases provided in the docstring suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True because they both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', even though their frequencies differ. The current implementation fails to meet this requirement."
exp_7_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a recursive approach.

exp_7_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to determine if the elements of the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation does not correctly handle cases where the list contains duplicate elements. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] is considered monotonically decreasing according to the implementation, but it should not be classified as such because of the presence of equal elements. The expected behavior for monotonicity should allow for equal elements in a non-decreasing or non-increasing sequence, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly."

It pushes an opening bracket onto the stack and pops from the stack for each closing bracket. If a closing bracket is encountered when the stack is empty, it returns False, indicating an unmatched closing bracket.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function passes all assertions, confirming its correctness."
exp_7_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function is incorrect because it does not properly compute the derivative of the polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial term ax^n is n*ax^(n-1). The current implementation incorrectly calculates the coefficients of the derivative. For example, for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the expected derivative is [1, 4, 12, 20], but the function returns [1, 4, 12, 20] which is correct. However, for the input [3, 2, 1, 0, 4], the expected output should be [12, 2, 0] but the function returns [2, 2, 0, 16]. This shows that the function does not handle all cases correctly."

The base cases for fibfib(0), fibfib(1), and fibfib(2) return the expected values of 0, 0, and 1, respectively. The recursive case correctly sums the values of fibfib(n-1), fibfib(n-2), and fibfib(n-3). The provided test assertions in the check function confirm that the implementation produces the correct outputs for the specified inputs, including fibfib(5) == 4, fibfib(8) == 24, and additional values like fibfib(10) == 81 and fibfib(12) == 274. Therefore, the implementation is correct."

The current implementation counts 'y' as a vowel in all cases, which leads to incorrect results for test cases like 'key' and 'bye'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly since it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, such as words with mixed case or words ending with 'y'. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."

According to the function's description, if 'shift' exceeds the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the string if 'shift' is greater than the length of 'x', which is correct. The issue arises in the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""', which is expected to return '001' but instead returns '00' because the leading zero is not preserved in the string representation of the integer. The correct behavior should maintain leading zeros in the output string, which is not achieved in the current implementation."

Similarly, the input 'abcCd' should yield 67 (67 for 'C'), but the expected result is also incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not match the expected outputs based on the provided test cases."

The code assumes that the number of oranges is always the third word in the string, which is not guaranteed. For example, in the string '5 apples and 6 oranges', the function correctly extracts '5' for apples but incorrectly extracts '6' for oranges because it only looks for the second index. The correct extraction should involve parsing the string more robustly to account for variations in the input format. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the number of oranges is not in the expected position."

Specifically, the function returns the smallest even value and its index, but it does not handle the case where multiple smallest even values exist correctly. The sorting step is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results when there are multiple even values with the same smallest value. Instead, the function should iterate through the list and keep track of the smallest even value and its index without sorting. This would ensure that the first occurrence of the smallest even value is returned, which is required by the problem statement."

The formula used, (a * b * c) ** (1/2), does not yield the correct area of a triangle given its sides. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle using the lengths of its sides (a, b, c) is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area values in the test cases do not match the results produced by the current implementation, indicating that the function does not return the correct area for valid triangles."

exp_7_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' is overly complex and does not correctly handle all cases. It uses a series of conditional statements for arrays of specific lengths (up to 5), which is not scalable and does not cover all possible scenarios for larger arrays. The logic for determining the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is flawed, as it does not compare elements symmetrically from the start and end of the array. A more efficient approach would involve iterating through the array from both ends towards the center, counting mismatches. The provided test cases may pass, but the function will fail for larger or different inputs, making it incorrect overall."

However, the current implementation only checks if the number can be expressed as the product of two prime factors (i and a/i). It does not account for the requirement of three prime factors. Additionally, the test case assertions include cases that are not correctly handled by the function, such as is_multiply_prime(8) which should return False because 8 = 2 * 2 * 2 (not three distinct primes). The logic for checking the number of prime factors is incomplete and incorrect."

For example, for 'is_simple_power(8, 2)', the expected result is True, but the current implementation will not return True as it does not correctly compute the integer exponent. The correct approach would involve checking if there exists an integer 'k' such that 'n**k == x'. This flaw leads to incorrect results for several test cases, such as 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' which should return True but does not in the current implementation."

However, this approach fails for negative numbers because the cube root of a negative number is also negative, and converting it to an integer may not yield the correct result for the equality check. For example, iscube(-8) would return False incorrectly, as -8 is indeed a perfect cube (-2 * -2 * -2 = -8). Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect; it should check for 1728 instead, which is a perfect cube (12 * 12 * 12 = 1728)."
exp_7_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'hex_key' is intended to count the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime. However, it incorrectly includes 'A', 'C', 'E', and 'F' as valid hexadecimal digits without checking their primality. The correct prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11), and D (13). The function does not account for the fact that 'A', 'C', 'E', and 'F' are not prime numbers. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is incorrect because the function does not handle an empty string input correctly; it should return 0, but the function is designed to take a string, not a list. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."

Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_7_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct. The current implementation only checks if any three consecutive letters are the same, which is not sufficient. For example, the string 'abcabc' would pass the current implementation but is not happy because 'abc' contains three distinct letters. The correct approach should check that s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] are all different."
exp_7_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values that are equal to the thresholds for letter grades. For example, the GPA of 3.0 should yield 'B+', but the code assigns 'B+' to any GPA greater than or equal to 3.0, which is correct. However, the GPA of 3.5 is incorrectly assigned 'A-' instead of 'A'. The function also incorrectly assigns 'D+' for a GPA of 1.0 instead of 'D+'. The test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, and the implementation does not match the grading table provided in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' incorrectly identifies the length of strings as prime. Specifically, it returns True for a string of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the logic used to determine if a number is prime is flawed; it checks divisibility from 2 to the length of the string, but it should only check up to the square root of the length for efficiency and correctness. For example, the string 'HI' has a length of 2, which is prime, but the function will return True, which is correct. However, the function fails for lengths like 1 and 4, which are not prime but would return True due to the flawed implementation. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'starts_one_ends' counts the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the total count. For n=1, the only number is '1', which is correctly counted as 1. For n=2, the valid numbers are '10', '11', '12', ..., '19', '21', ..., '91', '01', which totals to 18. However, for n=3, the count should include numbers from 100 to 999 that start or end with 1, which is not correctly calculated by the current logic. The function uses a brute-force approach, which is inefficient for larger n and does not account for the patterns in the numbers. A more mathematical approach would yield the correct counts without iterating through all possibilities."
exp_7_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer N, but it instead returns the binary representation of N itself. For example, for N = 1000, the sum of the digits is 1, and the expected output is '1'. However, the function returns '1111101000', which is the binary representation of 1000. The test assertions are based on the incorrect assumption that the function is correctly implemented."
exp_7_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices, but the implementation incorrectly sums the elements at even indices instead.

Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement as described in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'anti_shuffle' does not correctly sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces in the input string. The current implementation uses 'sorted(s.split(), key=lambda x: ''.join(sorted(x)))', which sorts the words based on their sorted characters, but it does not sort the characters within each word. Instead, it should sort the characters of each word individually and then join them back together while maintaining the original order of the words and spaces. For example, 'Hello World!!!' should yield 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation does not achieve this correctly."

After finding the coordinates of the target integer 'x', the function sorts the list of tuples by rows in ascending order, but it does not sort the coordinates of each row by columns in descending order. Instead, it modifies the column index to be the reverse index (from the end of the row), which does not fulfill the requirement of sorting by columns in descending order. Therefore, the output does not match the expected results in all test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' does not correctly adhere to the specified sorting criteria based on the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of checking the sum of the first and last elements, it incorrectly checks the sum of all elements in the array. This leads to incorrect sorting behavior for cases where the sum of the first and last elements is odd or even. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the first element is 2 and the last element is 6, which sums to 8 (even), so it should sort in descending order, which is correctly implemented. However, for the input [21, 14, 23, 11], the first element is 21 and the last element is 11, which sums to 32 (even), but the expected output is incorrect as it does not follow the specified sorting criteria based on the first and last elements."

The function is supposed to rotate the alphabet by four places (2 multiplied by 2), but the current implementation uses the expression 'ord(x) - 97 + 2 * 2', which effectively shifts each character by four positions. However, it does not account for the fact that the input string may contain characters outside the lowercase alphabet (like spaces or uppercase letters), and it assumes all characters are lowercase letters. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function do not match the expected outputs based on the described behavior of the 'encrypt' function. For example, the output for 'faewfawefaewg' should not be 'jeiajeaijeiak' based on a correct implementation of the described rotation. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_7_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is not unique. For example, in the case of next_smallest([1,1,1,1,0]), the expected output should be None because there is no distinct second smallest element. However, the function returns 1, which is incorrect. Additionally, the case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -35 as the second smallest element, but the function will sort the list and return -35, which is correct in this case. Overall, the implementation fails to meet the requirement of returning None when there is no distinct second smallest element."
exp_7_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' only splits the input string by periods ('.') to identify sentences. However, the problem statement specifies that sentences can also be delimited by question marks ('?') and exclamation marks ('!'). As a result, sentences that end with these delimiters will not be counted correctly. For example, the input 'I love it! I am happy.' would not be counted correctly because the second sentence is not split properly. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the task."
exp_7_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' does not correctly handle the case where the sum of any two numbers equals the third number. The current implementation only checks if 'x' equals the sum of 'y' and 'z', but it should also check if 'y' equals 'x + z' and if 'z' equals 'x + y'. Additionally, the method 'is_integer()' is not applicable to integers, which will cause an error when checking integer values. The function should use 'isinstance()' to check if the inputs are integers instead."
exp_7_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly implement the encoding as described. It fails to swap the case of all letters and does not replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the alphabet. For example, in the case of 'test', the expected output is 'TGST', but the function will return 'tGST' because it does not swap the case of the consonants and incorrectly handles the vowels. Additionally, the vowel replacement logic is flawed; it should replace 'a' with 'c', 'e' with 'g', 'i' with 'k', 'o' with 'q', and 'u' with 'w', but the current implementation incorrectly attempts to access the character at index `i+2` without proper bounds checking, which could lead to index errors."

It filters out numbers from 0 to 57 without checking for primality, which is not the correct approach to find prime numbers. Additionally, the function does not compute the sum of the digits of the largest prime found, which is the requirement of the task. The test assertions will likely fail because the function does not perform the necessary calculations to return the expected results."
exp_7_HumanEval/95,HumanEval/95,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'check_dict_case' does not correctly determine if all keys are either in lower case or upper case. The condition 'elif key.isupper() != key.islower()' is incorrect because it only checks if the key is either upper or lower case, but does not ensure that all keys are uniformly in one case. The correct approach should involve checking if all keys are lower case or if all keys are upper case, which can be done using two separate flags or checks. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the dictionary is empty correctly, as it should return False, which it does, but the logic for checking the case of keys is flawed."
exp_7_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'count_up_to' is incorrect because it does not correctly return the prime numbers less than 'n'. For example, the output for 'count_up_to(6)' should be [2, 3, 5], but the function returns [2, 3, 5] which is correct. However, for 'count_up_to(7)', it incorrectly returns [2, 3, 5] instead of [2, 3, 5, 7]. Additionally, the function does not handle cases for 'n' greater than 24 correctly, as it is incomplete and ends abruptly. The function should dynamically calculate prime numbers rather than relying on hardcoded values."
exp_7_HumanEval/97,HumanEval/97,True,INCORRECT,"The function multiply is supposed to return the product of the unit digits of the two integers. However, the expected outputs in the test cases do not match the actual outputs of the function. For instance, multiply(19, 28) should return 72, but the unit digits are 9 and 8, which multiply to 72. The function correctly computes the unit digits but fails to account for the expected outputs in the test cases. Specifically, the expected output for multiply(148, 412) is incorrectly stated as 16, as the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16. The expected output for multiply(76, 67) is also incorrect; the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect based on the provided test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/98,HumanEval/98,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_upper is intended to count uppercase vowels at even indices of the string. However, the test case count_upper('EEEE') returns 2, which is incorrect because the uppercase vowels 'E' are located at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3. Only the characters at even indices (0 and 2) should be counted, which means the correct return value should be 1. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the requirement of counting uppercase vowels at even indices."

Similarly, when n is odd, it should add 2 to n for the next level, but the base case for n=1 is also incorrect since it should return a list starting from n. The test cases provided in the 'check' function will fail due to these issues."
exp_7_HumanEval/101,HumanEval/101,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'words_string' does not correctly handle the splitting of words when they are separated by both commas and spaces.

It only checks if x is even and returns it if y is greater than or equal to x, but it does not consider the case where y is greater than x and there might be a larger even number within the range. For example, for the input (6, 29), the function returns 6 instead of 28, which is the largest even number in that range. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x is greater than y correctly, as it should return -1 in such cases regardless of the parity of x."

The average should be calculated as the sum of all integers from n to m divided by the count of those integers, which is (m - n + 1). The current implementation only averages n and m, which leads to incorrect results for cases where n and m are not the same. For example, rounded_avg(1, 5) should compute the average of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which is 3, and return '0b11', but the implementation does this correctly. However, for cases like rounded_avg(7, 13), the average should be 10, which is '0b1010', but the implementation does not handle this correctly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The condition 'not any(j%2==0 for j in str(i))' checks if any digit in the number is even, but it incorrectly converts the digits to strings, which leads to incorrect evaluations. For example, the number 152 contains the digit '2', which is even, but the function does not correctly identify it as having an even digit. Therefore, the output for the test case 'unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])' should be an empty list, which is correct, but the function fails to handle other cases correctly, such as 'unique_digits([12345, 2033, 111, 151])' where it should return [111, 151] but might not due to the flawed logic."

Firstly, the sorting and reversing of the array are done before filtering the integers between 1 and 9, which is incorrect. The filtering should occur first to ensure only valid integers are processed. Additionally, the mapping of integers to their corresponding names is not implemented; instead, the code attempts to convert integers to strings without any mapping. The excessive repetition of the line 'arr = [str(i) for i in arr]' is unnecessary and does not contribute to the functionality. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results as demonstrated in the test assertions."

The function only checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order for specific lengths (up to 13), which is inefficient and incorrect. The correct approach should involve checking for the number of 'drops' in the array, where a drop is defined as a point where the current element is greater than the next element. If there is more than one drop, it is impossible to sort the array with right shifts.

The function should instead check if there are enough even numbers in 'lst2' to replace the odd numbers in 'lst1'.

Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include assertions that expect outputs based on the incorrect implementation, leading to further discrepancies."
exp_7_HumanEval/129,HumanEval/129,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function minPath contains several issues. Firstly, the initialization of the grid with padding (adding -1) is incorrect and unnecessary, as it alters the original grid structure and does not contribute to the pathfinding logic. Secondly, the BFS algorithm is not correctly implemented to track the path values; it only calculates distances without storing the actual path taken. The logic for reconstructing the path at the end is flawed, as it attempts to backtrack using the grid values instead of maintaining a proper parent or predecessor mapping. Additionally, the test assertions include expected outputs that do not align with the problem description, indicating that the function does not produce the correct results for the provided test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/130,HumanEval/130,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'tri' function does not correctly compute the Tribonacci sequence as described in the comments. The recurrence relation for odd n is incorrectly defined and implemented. Specifically, the function does not calculate 'tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)' for odd n, and instead, it simply returns a static list for n >= 2. Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions do not match the expected results based on the defined Tribonacci sequence. For example, 'tri(3)' should return [1, 3, 2, 8], but the implementation does not correctly calculate the values leading to that output."

The expression 'i for i in str(n) if i%2!= 0' attempts to filter odd digits, but 'i' is a string character, and using the modulus operator '%' on a string will raise a TypeError. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it will raise an error when trying to reduce an empty list. The correct approach should convert the characters back to integers before applying the modulus operator and handle the case of no odd digits by returning 0."
exp_7_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_nested' does not correctly determine if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested. The current logic only checks if there are more opening brackets '[' than closing brackets ']', which does not guarantee that the brackets are nested. For example, the input '[][]' would return True (due to having equal counts), but it does not contain any nested brackets. The function fails to satisfy the requirements outlined in the comments and the test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' incorrectly uses 'int(round(x))' to round the numbers. The task requires rounding to the upper integer (ceiling), which should be done using 'math.ceil(x)' instead of 'round'. This will lead to incorrect results for non-integer values. For example, 'math.ceil(1.4)' should return 2, but 'int(round(1.4))' returns 1. Consequently, the test assertions that rely on the correct rounding will fail."
exp_7_HumanEval/134,HumanEval/134,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly determine if the last character is part of a word. The condition 'txt[-1] not in txt[:-1]' is meant to check if the last character is not part of any word, but it fails in cases where the last character is a letter that is part of a word. For example, in the string 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed part of a word, but the function would incorrectly return True. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string has trailing spaces correctly, as it does not check for spaces before the last character. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."

However, the function will return 1 because it only checks the first occurrence and stops. Additionally, the test case can_arrange([1,2,4,5]) is expected to return -1, which is correct, but the logic in the function does not cover all scenarios correctly."
exp_7_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly identify the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. Specifically, the function sorts the list and then checks only the first element for negativity, which does not guarantee that the largest negative integer is found. Additionally, it incorrectly returns the smallest positive integer as the first element of the sorted list, which may not be correct if there are multiple positive integers. For example, in the case of the input [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, -2], the expected output is (-2, 1), but the function may not return this correctly due to its flawed logic."
exp_7_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle string representations of numbers correctly, especially when they contain commas or periods. For example, the input compare_one(1, '2,3') should convert '2,3' to a float (2.3) before comparison, but the current implementation compares the values as they are, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the function does not handle the conversion of strings to numbers, which is necessary for proper comparison. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

However, the implementation only checks for specific even numbers up to 150 and returns True for them, which is incorrect. For example, 14 can be expressed as 2 + 2 + 2 + 8, but it is not included in the True cases. Additionally, the function does not consider the fact that any even number greater than or equal to 8 can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's purpose."
exp_7_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' does not correctly compute the Brazilian factorial as defined in the comments. The function currently only computes the regular factorial of 'n' recursively, which does not account for the multiplication of all factorials from (n-1)! down to 1!. The correct implementation should involve a loop or recursive calls that multiply the factorials of all integers from 1 to n. Therefore, the test cases will fail, as the expected results do not match the output of the current implementation."

The current implementation replaces all spaces with underscores first and then attempts to replace underscores with hyphens, which does not achieve the desired behavior. For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but it will not because the underscores are not correctly replaced based on the number of consecutive spaces."

The check for the length of the file name being greater than 3 is incorrect; it should be checking the count of digits instead. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the substring after the dot is empty, nor does it correctly validate the file extension against the allowed list. The logic for checking the dot and the starting character is also flawed, as it does not account for the position of the dot correctly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."

Specifically, the function squares the integer at index 0 (which is correct), but it also incorrectly cubes the integer at index 4 when it should not, as index 4 is not a multiple of 3. Additionally, the function modifies the original list, which is not specified in the requirements. The test cases also include cases that the function fails to pass, such as the case with the list [-56,-99,1,0,-2], which should return 3030 but does not due to incorrect calculations. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_7_HumanEval/143,HumanEval/143,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly return words whose lengths are prime numbers. The function uses 'return''.join(...)' which concatenates the words without spaces, leading to incorrect output. Additionally, the function does not define the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for checking if the length of a word is prime. Without this function, the code will raise an error when executed. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_7_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly determine if the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality rather than checking if the product is a whole number. To check if the product of the fractions x and n is a whole number, the correct condition should be 'if (x_num * n_num) % (x_den * n_den) == 0'. This means that the numerator of the product must be divisible by the denominator of the product. As a result, the function fails for several test cases, such as 'simplify(""1/5"", ""1/5"")' which should return True, but the current implementation returns False."
exp_7_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not maintain the original order of elements with the same sum of digits. The `sort` method is stable, but the lambda function used for sorting only considers the sum of the digits and does not account for the original indices of the elements when the sums are equal.

exp_7_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' does not correctly check the first digit of the number. The condition '(num // 10) % 2 == 1' only checks the second digit for oddness, not the first digit. For example, the number 21 would pass the current check because 2 is even, but it should not be counted since the first digit (2) is not odd.

It only checks for valid planet names and returns an empty tuple in most cases. Additionally, the variable 'planets' is not defined in the provided code, which would lead to a NameError. The function should also handle the case where the planets are in the correct order and return the planets in between them. The repeated checks for planet names are redundant and indicate a lack of proper implementation."

However, the implementation incorrectly checks if n is even (n % 2 == 0) to determine the return value. This logic does not correctly identify prime numbers, as many odd numbers are not prime (e.g., 9, 15). The test cases also include assertions that would fail due to this incorrect logic. For example, x_or_y(7, 34, 12) should return 34 (correct), but x_or_y(15, 8, 5) should return 5 (correct), yet the implementation does not correctly handle all cases of prime checking."

The current logic only checks if 'b' is a substring starting from each index of 'a', which does not account for the rotations of 'b'. For example, the rotation of 'b' should be checked by concatenating 'b' with itself (i.e., 'b + b') and then checking if any substring of this concatenated string exists in 'a'. Additionally, the loop will prematurely return False after the first iteration if 'b' is not found at the first index, which is incorrect. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."

The correct logic should account for the fact that if the rabbit cannot meet its needs, it should eat all remaining carrots and still be hungry. For example, in the case of 'eat(2, 11, 5)', the rabbit should eat all 5 remaining carrots, resulting in a total of 7 eaten and 0 remaining, which is correctly handled, but the condition fails for other cases.

exp_8_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function rescale_to_unit is designed to rescale a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output is not valid. The correct output for this input should be [1.0, 0.0] if the function is applied correctly, but the assertion is misleading as it implies that the order of the output should match the input order, which is not the case in the context of rescaling. The function itself is correct, but the test case is flawed."
exp_8_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension that checks if each value is an instance of 'int', which aligns with the function's purpose as described in the docstring. The provided test cases in the 'check' function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they return the expected results for various inputs."
exp_8_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, and they all pass successfully. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_8_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'largest_divisor' is supposed to find the largest divisor of 'n' that is smaller than 'n'. However, the implementation starts the loop from 'n' and checks for divisibility, which will return 'n' itself on the first iteration. The correct implementation should start from 'n-1' and go downwards to find the largest divisor smaller than 'n'. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements as it does not return the correct result for any input 'n' greater than 1."
exp_8_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'factorize' does not correctly return the prime factors of the input integer. Specifically, the inner loop iterates from 2 to n, which can lead to incorrect factorization. For example, when factorizing 70, the function will return [2, 5, 7] correctly, but for other numbers like 18, it will not return [2, 3, 3] as expected. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input number is a prime number or a composite number with repeated factors correctly. The test assertions also include cases that the implementation fails to satisfy, such as factorizing 9, which should return [3, 3] but will not be tested here. Overall, the implementation does not guarantee the correct order or count of prime factors."
exp_8_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list, but the implementation incorrectly retains elements that appear only once. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4] because 2 occurs more than once and should be removed. However, the implementation retains 2 in the output, which is incorrect. The assertion check(candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])) fails because the output is not as expected."
exp_8_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The use of 'swapcase()' effectively changes lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

exp_8_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The function 'concatenate' correctly implements the logic to concatenate a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the behavior of 'concatenate' against various cases, including an empty list and a list with multiple strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements."
exp_8_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']) is incorrect because it expects 'xxxAAA' to be included in the result, but 'xxxAAA' does not start with 'xxx' (it starts with 'xxxA'). The correct output should only include 'xxx' and not 'xxxAAA'. Therefore, the implementation does not pass all test assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function get_positive correctly filters out non-positive numbers from the input list, returning only positive numbers as specified in the docstring. The test assertions provided in the check function validate the correctness of the implementation against various scenarios, including lists with negative numbers, a mix of positive and negative numbers, and empty lists. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_8_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the is_prime function is incorrect because it does not efficiently check for prime numbers. Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. A prime number check only needs to iterate up to the square root of n. Additionally, the function does not handle the case for n = 2 correctly, as it will return True, but the loop will still run unnecessarily. This could lead to performance issues for larger numbers. The test cases provided in the check function do include cases that would fail with the current implementation, such as when n is a composite number."
exp_8_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function contains a logical error in the way it calculates the zero of the polynomial. The method used to update 'x' in the loop does not guarantee convergence to a root of the polynomial. Specifically, the expression 'x -= xs[i] / poly(xs[i + 1:], x)' can lead to incorrect results, as it does not properly account for the behavior of the polynomial at the current estimate of 'x'. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the polynomial may not have a real root or where the method fails to converge. The test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the correctness of the 'find_zero' function, but since 'poly' is being tested instead, it does not validate the correctness of 'find_zero'. Therefore, the overall implementation is incorrect."
exp_8_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it appends the sorted value of the individual element at that index, which is incorrect. The function should collect all values at indices divisible by three, sort them, and then replace the corresponding indices in the new list with these sorted values. The test assertions also indicate that the expected output does not match the actual output of the function."
exp_8_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to eliminate duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the resulting unique elements. The provided test assertion also confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given input, producing the correct output."
exp_8_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct, as it uses the built-in 'max' function to return the maximum element from the list. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], but it incorrectly expects the result to be 124 instead of the correct maximum value, which is 124. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed due to the faulty test case."
exp_8_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The function fizz_buzz is intended to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. However, the implementation only checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and counts the occurrences of '7' in those numbers. The provided test cases indicate that the expected counts of '7's for certain inputs do not match the actual counts produced by the function. For example, the expected output for fizz_buzz(78) is 2, but the function counts the occurrences incorrectly. The logic for counting '7's is flawed, as it does not account for all numbers divisible by 11 or 13 correctly. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_8_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly return a list where the even indices are sorted while the odd indices remain unchanged. The current implementation creates a new list 'l_odd' that only contains the values from the odd indices and appends the sorted even values to it, which results in a list that does not maintain the original structure of the input list. Instead, the function should create a new list that combines the sorted even indexed values and the unchanged odd indexed values in their respective positions."
exp_8_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it incorrectly checks 'encode_cyclic' instead. Additionally, the 'decode_cyclic' function is implemented correctly to reverse the encoding done by 'encode_cyclic'. Therefore, the test assertions are not validating the decoding functionality as intended."
exp_8_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is not correctly implemented to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. The current implementation only handles the first two cases (n=1 and n=2) correctly by returning 2 and 3, respectively. For n >= 3, it calls a function 'fibonacci(n)', which is not defined in the provided code. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence does not guarantee that the n-th Fibonacci number is prime; thus, the logic to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_8_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is not implemented, which means it cannot produce any output or behavior. Therefore, it cannot pass any assertions in the 'check' function.

exp_8_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'car_race_collision' is not implemented, as it only contains a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not return any value, and the assertions in the 'check' function will fail. The expected output for the number of collisions is calculated as n * n (or n^2), which is indicated by the test assertions. However, without an implementation, the function cannot produce any output, leading to an incorrect evaluation."
exp_8_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is correctly implemented to increment each element of the list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test case is not validating the function correctly, leading to a failure in the test. Therefore, while the function itself is correct, the tests do not accurately reflect the expected behavior."
exp_8_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function pairs_sum_to_zero is incorrect because it does not correctly check for pairs of distinct elements that sum to zero. The current logic only checks adjacent elements after sorting the list, which can miss valid pairs that are not next to each other. For example, in the test case pairs_sum_to_zero([-3, 9, -1, 3, 2, 30]), the function should return True because -3 and 3 are distinct elements that sum to zero, but the current implementation may not find this pair due to the sorting step. A correct approach would involve checking all combinations of elements to find any two distinct elements that sum to zero."
exp_8_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is designed to convert a number 'x' into a specified base 'base', but it does not handle cases where the base is greater than 10 correctly. The test case 'assert candidate(9, 3) == ""100""' is incorrect because the expected output for converting 9 to base 3 should be '100', which is correct. However, the function's implementation does not account for bases greater than 10, which is not explicitly stated in the comments. Additionally, the comment states that base numbers are less than 10, which contradicts the test cases provided. Therefore, the implementation is not consistent with the function's description and the test cases."

All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the implementation is correct."
exp_8_HumanEval/46,HumanEval/46,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fib4 function uses recursion instead of an iterative approach as specified in the comments. This violates the requirement to not use recursion. Additionally, the expected outputs for the test cases provided in the comments do not match the outputs generated by the current implementation. For example, fib4(5) should return 4 according to the comments, but the recursive implementation does not compute this correctly due to the incorrect base cases and recursive logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is correct in terms of logic, but the test assertions provided in the check function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]) == 8.0' is incorrect; the correct median for this input should be 15.0, as the sorted list is [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000] and the median is the average of 6 and 10. Therefore, the test cases do not accurately reflect the expected outputs, leading to a failure in the test."

exp_8_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode_shift' function is incorrect because it does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet ('a' to 'z'). It assumes that all input characters are lowercase letters, which can lead to incorrect behavior or errors when the input contains uppercase letters, digits, or special characters. Additionally, the 'decode_shift' function is supposed to decode the string encoded by 'encode_shift', but it also has the same issue with character handling. The test assertions in the 'check' function will fail if the input string contains any characters that are not lowercase letters."

The test cases suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return False, which is correct, but 'abcd' and 'dddddddabc' should return False, which is incorrect according to the function's logic. The function should compare the unique characters in both strings, not their sorted versions."

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function passes all assertions, confirming its correctness."
exp_8_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly returns True for lists that contain equal elements in a decreasing sequence. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False because it is not strictly decreasing (due to the repeated '1'). The test case for this input in the 'check' function expects True, which is inconsistent with the definition of monotonicity. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly adhere to the function's description."

For example, for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the expected output should be [1, 4, 12, 20], but the implementation returns [1, 4, 12, 20] as expected. However, the test case with input [3, 2, 1, 0, 4] should yield [12, 2, 0] instead of [2, 2, 0, 16]. Therefore, the implementation fails to correctly compute the derivative for all cases."

The code assumes that the number of oranges is always the third element in the split string, which is not guaranteed. For example, in the string '5 apples and 6 oranges', the number of oranges is at index 4 after splitting, not index 2. This will lead to incorrect results for any input where the number of oranges is not at the expected position. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct number of mangoes in certain cases, making the overall implementation incorrect."

The line 'min_even_value_index = even_values.index(min_even_value)' retrieves the index of 'min_even_value' in the 'even_values' list, which does not correspond to the original index in the input array 'arr'. This leads to incorrect results when there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even value. For example, in the case of 'candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])', the function would return [0, 1] instead of [0, 1] because it finds the first zero in the 'even_values' list, which is not the correct index in the original array."

Specifically, it does not count the frequency of each integer in the list and does not check if that frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself. The current implementation only returns the first integer it encounters that is greater than zero, without considering its frequency. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4])', the expected output is -1, but the function would return 5, which is incorrect.

The current implementation uses 'sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x%2)', which sorts the list based on whether the numbers are even or odd, rather than alternating between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, such as 'strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])' returning [1, 2, 3, 4] instead of the expected [1, 4, 2, 3]. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the comments."

The formula used, (a * b * c) / (4 * (a + b + c)), does not yield the correct area for a triangle given its sides. The correct formula for the area of a triangle using its side lengths is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the test case for triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is expected to return approximately 0.43, but it should actually return 0.43 when calculated correctly using Heron's formula, which is not being used here."

The implementation only checks if the sum is less than or equal to 'w', but it does not return True if the sum is exactly equal to 'w' and the list is balanced. For example, will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) should return True, which it does, but if we had a case like will_it_fly([1, 2, 1], 4), it would incorrectly return False because the sum is equal to 'w' but the list is balanced. Therefore, the implementation does not fully satisfy the requirements outlined in the function description."

The test cases also reveal that the function incorrectly returns True for 8 and 125, which are not products of three distinct primes. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_8_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The function implementation does not correctly determine if x is a simple power of n. The expression 'n ** int(math.log(x, n))' can lead to incorrect results due to the use of integer conversion, which may truncate the logarithm value and lead to incorrect exponentiation.

However, for is_simple_power(24, 2), the logarithm would yield a value that, when truncated, does not accurately reflect the power relationship, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x is not a power of n correctly, as seen in the test cases provided."

For example, for n=2, the valid integers are 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, 21, 31, ..., 91, totaling 18, which is correct, but the function's logic does not efficiently derive this.

Similarly, for N = 150, the sum of its digits is 6, which should return '110', but the function returns '10010110' (the binary representation of 150).

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle sorting for arrays larger than two elements, as it only checks the first and last elements for arrays of length 2 to 15 but does not sort the array properly.

The function does not handle cases where n is greater than 24 correctly, as it is incomplete and does not provide the correct output for larger values of n. Additionally, the function does not return the correct number of primes for inputs like 7 and 10.

However, for multiply(148, 412), the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16, so this is also correct. The issue arises with the test case multiply(14, -15), where the unit digits are 4 and 5, which multiply to 20, which is correct. However, the test case multiply(76, 67) should return 42, but the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42, so this is also correct.

exp_8_HumanEval/130,HumanEval/130,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'tri' function does not correctly compute the Tribonacci sequence as described in the comments. The recurrence relation for odd 'n' is incorrectly defined, and the base cases do not align with the expected output. For instance, 'tri(3)' should return '8' based on the recurrence relation, but the current implementation does not calculate it correctly. Additionally, the test assertions expect floating-point numbers (e.g., '2.0', '8.0'), which are not consistent with the expected integer outputs of the Tribonacci sequence. The function also does not handle the odd case correctly, leading to incorrect results for larger values of 'n'."
exp_8_HumanEval/131,HumanEval/131,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'digits' function contains an error in the list comprehension where it attempts to filter odd digits. The expression 'x for x in str(n) if x%2!= 0' is incorrect because 'x' is a string (character) and cannot be used directly in a modulus operation. This will raise a TypeError. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no odd digits correctly, as it would attempt to multiply an empty list, which would raise a ValueError. The expected behavior is to return 0 if all digits are even, but this is not implemented correctly."
exp_8_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_nested' does not correctly determine if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested. The current implementation only checks if there is at least one '[' and one ']', which is insufficient for the requirements. For example, the input '[][]' would return True, but it should return False since there are no nested brackets. The function fails to account for the actual nesting structure of the brackets."
exp_8_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,INCORRECT,"The function sum_squares is expected to return the sum of squared numbers after rounding each element in the list to the upper integer (ceiling). However, the implementation does not handle negative numbers correctly. For example, the ceiling of -1.4 should be -1, but the implementation rounds it to 0, leading to incorrect results for negative inputs. This is evident in the test case assert candidate([-1.4, 4.6, 6.3])==75, which fails because the ceiling values should be [0, 5, 7], resulting in a sum of squares of 0^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 74, not 75. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The condition 'txt[-1] not in txt[:-1]' checks if the last character is not present in the rest of the string, which is not a valid way to determine if it is part of a word. For example, in the case of 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed part of a word, but the function would return True incorrectly. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the string ends with spaces properly, which should also return False."
exp_8_HumanEval/135,HumanEval/135,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'can_arrange' is not implemented, as it contains only a 'pass' statement. Therefore, it does not perform any operations or return any values, which means it cannot produce the expected results for the provided test cases.

exp_8_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. Specifically, when there are multiple negative integers, it should return the largest one, but the current implementation does not handle the case where the largest negative integer is not the first one encountered. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where there are no positive integers, as it will return the first positive integer found instead of None. For example, the test case 'largest_smallest_integers([-1, -3, -5, -6])' should return (-1, None) but the implementation would return (None, None) because it does not correctly track the largest negative integer. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

The current implementation first replaces all spaces with underscores, and then attempts to replace underscores with hyphens, which does not achieve the intended behavior. For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but it will not due to the incorrect replacement logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'file_name_check' does not correctly enforce the constraints specified in the comments. Specifically, it fails to check the number of digits in the file name, which is a critical condition. The first condition should ensure that there are no more than three digits in the entire file name, but the current implementation only checks the length of the file name. Additionally, the check for the substring before the dot being empty is correct, but the implementation does not validate that it starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return 'Yes' for some invalid cases, such as those containing more than three digits or starting with a non-alphabet character."

Specifically, the function squares the integer at index 0 (which is correct), but it also squares the integer at index 3 (which is correct), and cubes the integer at index 4 (which is incorrect because index 4 is not a multiple of 3). The function does not correctly apply the conditions for cubing integers at indices that are multiples of 4 but not multiples of 3. This leads to incorrect results for several test cases, such as 'candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2])' which should yield a different sum than what is produced by the current implementation."

However, the implementation does not include a definition for the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary to determine if the length of each word is prime. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the output for the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' is incorrect because the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, and thus should not be included in the output. The expected output is correct, but the implementation fails to handle the prime-checking logic."

However, the logic used in the function is flawed. The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality of cross products, which does not determine if the product of the fractions is a whole number. Instead, the correct approach should involve checking if the product of the fractions (x_num / x_den) * (n_num / n_den) results in an integer. This can be done by checking if (x_num * n_num) % (x_den * n_den) == 0. As a result, the function fails to return the correct boolean values for some test cases."

exp_8_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly check the first digit of the number. The condition '(num // 10) % 2 == 1' only checks the second digit for oddness, not the first digit. For example, for the number 15, the first digit is 1 (which is odd), but the condition fails for numbers like 21 (where the first digit is 2, which is even). The correct approach would involve extracting the first digit correctly, which can be done by converting the number to a string or using integer division in a loop until the number is less than 10."

However, the implementation incorrectly checks if n is even (n % 2 == 0) to determine the return value. This logic does not correctly identify prime numbers. For example, the number 3 is prime, but the function would return y (the second argument) because it is odd. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of n being less than 2, which are not prime numbers. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Specifically, it only sums the squares of odd integers, but it does not ignore negative numbers or non-integer values as specified. For example, the input [5, 4] should return 0 since 4 is not odd and 5 is the only odd number, but the implementation incorrectly returns 25. Additionally, the implementation does not handle the case of ignoring non-integer values correctly, as shown in the test case with floating-point numbers. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/152,HumanEval/152,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'compare' function does not correctly calculate the absolute difference between the game scores and the guesses. The function currently returns the absolute difference only for the first element of the arrays, as it does not iterate through all indices correctly.

However, the current implementation only checks for the exact substring match and does not consider rotations of the second word. For example, the rotation of 'yello' is 'loyel', which is not checked. The test cases in the 'check' function also indicate that the implementation fails to return correct results for certain inputs, such as 'efef' and 'fee', where the expected result is True but the function returns False. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of the task."
exp_8_HumanEval/155,HumanEval/155,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle negative numbers. When the input is negative, the '-' sign is included in the string representation of the number, which causes the function to attempt to convert it to an integer and check if it's even or odd.

Additionally, the function does not account for the digit '0' as an even digit correctly in the context of the assertions. The test cases provided also include some that are incorrect based on the expected behavior of the function, such as 'assert candidate(7) == (0, 1)' which is correct, but the function does not handle negative numbers properly."

It only checks the length of the words instead of counting unique characters. Additionally, it does not handle the case where multiple words have the same number of unique characters, as it does not compare them lexicographically.

However, it incorrectly returns 'need' as the second element of the array in the case where there are enough carrots to meet the need, which is not aligned with the requirement that if there are not enough remaining carrots, the rabbit will still be hungry. The test cases also reveal that the function fails to produce the expected outputs for certain inputs."

However, the current implementation evaluates the operations strictly from left to right without considering precedence, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the implementation does not handle the case of exponentiation correctly, as it does not account for the fact that it should be evaluated before addition and subtraction. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail, confirming the implementation is incorrect."

Specifically, it does not handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b' correctly, as it returns an empty list instead of the even numbers in the range. Additionally, the function does not correctly identify and return even numbers when 'a' is less than 'b'. For example, calling generate_integers(2, 10) should return [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], but it only returns [2, 4, 6, 8]. Furthermore, the test cases are not comprehensive enough to cover all edge cases, such as when both 'a' and 'b' are even or odd. The recursive approach also does not ensure that only even numbers are returned, as it adds 'a' directly without checking its parity."

The inner loop should iterate from 'i + 1' to 'len(numbers)', but it currently iterates from 'i + 1' to 'len(numbers) - 1'. This causes the last element to be excluded from the comparisons, leading to incorrect results in some cases. For example, in the test case 'has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3)', the function may not correctly identify that 2.2 and 2.0 are closer than 0.3 if the last comparison is skipped."

This results in an extra delimiter being added at the end of the list when there are multiple elements. For example, calling 'intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)' should return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], but the current implementation will return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] due to the way the recursion is structured."

exp_9_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rolling_max' does not correctly compute the rolling maximum for the input list. The issue arises because the initial maximum value is set to the first element of the list, and then it is updated only if the current number is greater than the previous maximum. This means that if the current number is less than the previous maximum, it will not be added to the result list as the maximum. For example, in the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], the expected output is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], but the function will return [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4] which is correct. However, the test case with [4, 3, 2, 1] should return [4, 4, 4, 4] but the implementation will return [4, 4, 4, 4], which is correct.

For example, if we input '111000' and '101010', the function will only consider the first three characters of each string, leading to an incorrect output. The test case check(candidate('111000', '101010') == '010010' will fail because the function will not process the entire strings correctly."

However, the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [1.0, 0.0] but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] as well, which is correct. The assertion is misleading as it implies the function is incorrect. The test case 'assert candidate([12.0, 11.0, 15.0, 13.0, 14.0]) == [0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]' is also incorrect because the expected output does not match the actual output of the function. The correct output should be [0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the implementation is incorrect due to the flawed test cases."

The loop starts from n and checks for divisors down to 1, but it returns n itself if n is prime or if n is 1. The expected behavior is to return the largest divisor smaller than n, which is not handled correctly. For example, for input 3, the function returns 3 instead of 1, which violates the requirement of finding a divisor smaller than n."

Specifically, it iterates through all integers from 2 to n, but it does not correctly account for multiple occurrences of the same prime factor. For example, when factorizing 70, it should return [2, 5, 7], but the current implementation will not produce the correct output for other composite numbers like 12 (which should return [2, 2, 3]). The test cases that involve higher powers of primes or combinations of different primes will also fail. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements stated in the docstring."
exp_9_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once from the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while preserving the first occurrence of each unique element. As a result, the test case 'assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]' fails because the output should include only elements that appear exactly once, which are 1, 4, and 5. The correct output for this test case should be [1, 4, 5], but the function does not achieve this as it retains the first occurrences of duplicates instead of removing all duplicates."

However, the test case check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')) is expected to return ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but it actually returns ['xxx', 'xxx'] because the implementation does not account for case sensitivity or the fact that 'xxxAAA' does not start with 'xxx'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as specified in the comments."

Specifically, the loop iterates from 2 to n-1, which is unnecessary. It should only check up to the square root of n, as any non-prime number n will have at least one factor less than or equal to its square root. This inefficiency can lead to performance issues for larger numbers. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases correctly, such as negative numbers or zero, which are not prime. The test cases provided in the check function are mostly correct, but the implementation fails to handle larger inputs efficiently."

Specifically, the method of iteratively adjusting 'x' using the formula 'x -= xs[i] / poly(xs[i + 1:], x)' does not guarantee convergence to a root of the polynomial. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the polynomial may have multiple roots or where the method may fail to find a root due to poor initial guesses. The test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the 'find_zero' function, but they are incorrectly checking the 'poly' function instead.

However, the implementation incorrectly sorts both even and odd indexed values and then reverses them before combining. This leads to incorrect results for the test cases. For instance, in the second test case, the expected output is [-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123], but the function does not produce this output due to the incorrect handling of odd indexed values."
exp_9_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The `check` function is incorrectly testing the `encode_cyclic` function instead of the `decode_cyclic` function. The assertion should be checking if `decode_cyclic(encoded_str)` equals the original string `str`, but it is currently checking `encode_cyclic(encoded_str)`, which does not make sense.

The expected behavior is to generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality until the n-th prime Fibonacci number is found, but this logic is missing. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the docstring and fails to pass the assertions in the 'check' function."
exp_9_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' simply returns False without performing any calculations to check for three distinct elements that sum to zero.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with no pairs summing to zero, lists with pairs summing to zero, and lists with only one element. All assertions in the check function pass, confirming the implementation is correct."

Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(16, 2) == ""10000""' is also incorrect because the correct representation of 16 in base 2 is '10000'.

For example, 2^30 modulo 5 should return 4, which is correct, but 2^31 modulo 5 should return 3, which is also correct. However, the function's implementation and the test cases do not cover all edge cases or potential issues with larger values of n and p. Therefore, while the function works for the provided test cases, it may not be robust for all inputs, leading to an overall evaluation of INCORRECT."

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases where the product of three primes is needed, as seen in the test cases. For example, the assertion candidate(8) == True is incorrect since 8 is not a product of three primes (it is 2 * 2 * 2).

Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect because 1729 is not a perfect cube, but the assertion is checking against 1728, which is a perfect cube (12^3).

This leads to incorrect counts for inputs that contain 'D' and 'E'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as it will return 0 instead of explicitly checking for it.

The current logic only checks if all three characters are the same (i.e., s[i] == s[i+1] == s[i+2]), which does not account for cases where the characters are different but not distinct. For example, the string 'abc' should return True, but the function would not correctly identify cases like 'aab' or 'abb' as False, even though they do not have three distinct characters. The correct logic should check if s[i], s[i+1], and s[i+2] are all different from each other."

Specifically, the condition for GPA 1.2 should return 'D-' instead of 'D+'. The correct mapping for GPA values below 1.0 is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect letter grades for certain inputs. For example, the test case 'assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']' fails because 1.2 should correspond to 'D-' according to the grading table."
exp_9_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' incorrectly determines whether the length of the string is a prime number. Specifically, it returns True for a string of length 1, which is not considered a prime number. Additionally, the logic for checking if a number is prime is flawed; it should check divisibility only up to the square root of the length, not the length itself. This leads to incorrect results for various string lengths, as evidenced by the test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The function starts_one_ends(n) is intended to count the n-digit positive integers that either start with 1 or end with 1. However, the current implementation does not account for the overlap of numbers that both start and end with 1. For example, for n=2, the numbers '11' is counted in both categories, leading to an overcount. The correct formula should subtract the overlap, which is 10**(n-2) for n > 1. Thus, the correct return value should be 10**(n-1) + 9*10**(n-2) - (10**(n-2)) for n > 1, simplifying to 10**(n-1) + 8*10**(n-2). The test cases provided would fail due to this issue."

For example, for N = 1000, the sum of its digits is 1, but the function returns '1111101000', which is the binary representation of 1000. The test cases provided in the 'check' function are based on the incorrect assumption that 'solve' computes the binary representation of the sum of the digits, leading to failures in the assertions."
exp_9_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the implementation currently sums the elements at even indices instead (i.e., it uses 'range(0, len(lst), 2)' which iterates over indices 0, 2, 4, etc.). This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases. For example, in the case of 'add([4, 2, 6, 7])', the expected output is 2 (the even number at index 1), but the function will return 10 (the sum of 4 and 6 at indices 0 and 2). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_9_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `anti_shuffle` does not correctly sort the characters within each word while preserving the order of the words and spaces. The current implementation splits the string into words, sorts the words based on their sorted characters, and then joins them back together, which does not achieve the desired outcome. For example, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation does not maintain the original order of words and spaces correctly. Instead, it sorts the words themselves rather than the characters within each word."
exp_9_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates of the columns in descending order. After finding the coordinates of the integer 'x', the function sorts them by rows in ascending order, but then it modifies the column indices to be in descending order without properly sorting the coordinates based on this new column index. This results in an incorrect output for cases where multiple occurrences of 'x' exist in the same row. For example, in the test case with input '1', the expected output is not achieved due to this sorting issue."
exp_9_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' does not correctly handle the sorting logic based on the sum of the first and last elements. The function only checks the sum of the entire array, which is not aligned with the requirement to check the sum of the first and last index values. Additionally, the function contains redundant code for handling different lengths of the array, which is unnecessary. The correct implementation should sort the array in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, and in descending order if it is even. The provided test cases will fail for cases where the sum of the first and last elements is not considered."

The comment states that the letters should shift down by two multiplied by two places, which implies a shift of 4 positions (2 * 2 = 4). However, the code currently shifts each letter by 4 positions using the expression `(alphabet.index(i)+2)*2`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should simply be `alphabet.index(i) + 4`. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases, as evidenced by the failed assertions."
exp_9_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is not unique. For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the expected output is None because there is no distinct second smallest element. However, the function returns 1, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not account for negative numbers correctly, as seen in the test case with negative values. The implementation also does not check for duplicates properly, leading to incorrect results in cases where the second smallest element is the same as the smallest."
exp_9_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' does not correctly count the number of sentences that start with the word 'I'. The current implementation counts the total number of sentence delimiters ('.', '?', '!') and subtracts the count of 'I' in the string, which does not reflect the actual requirement. Instead, the function should split the input string into sentences based on the delimiters and then check if each sentence starts with 'I'. This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases, such as Test 5, where the expected output is 2 but the function would not correctly identify the sentences starting with 'I'."
exp_9_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' does not correctly check if all three numbers are integers before evaluating the condition. The current implementation only checks if 'x' is equal to the sum of 'y' and 'z' and whether 'x' is an integer. It fails to check if 'y' and 'z' are integers before returning True. This leads to incorrect results for cases where 'y' and 'z' are not integers, even if 'x' is. For example, 'any_int(3.0, 4, 7)' should return False, but it incorrectly returns True because it only checks 'x'. The function should check if all three numbers are integers before performing the sum check."

Additionally, there is no logic implemented to check if all keys are either in lower case or upper case. The function should iterate through the keys of the dictionary, checking their case, and return True only if all keys are consistently in one case. The test assertions provided would fail due to these issues."
exp_9_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,False,INCORRECT,"The function count_up_to is supposed to return an array of the first n prime numbers that are less than n. However, the implementation uses hardcoded values for each possible input, which is not a correct approach for generating prime numbers. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case for n = 6, where it should return [2, 3, 5] but instead returns [2, 3, 5, 7]. The function also fails to return the correct list of primes for inputs greater than 24, as it is incomplete. A proper implementation should dynamically calculate prime numbers rather than relying on hardcoded values."

However, the expected results in the test cases are incorrect. For example, multiply(148, 412) should return 32 (8 * 4), not 16. Similarly, multiply(19, 28) should return 72 (9 * 8), not 72, and multiply(14, -15) should return 20 (4 * 5), which is correct. The test cases contain errors in their expected outputs, leading to incorrect assertions."

However, the test case count_upper('EEEE') is expected to return 2, but it actually returns 1 because it only checks the characters at indices 0 and 2 (which are both 'E'). The function does not account for the fact that there are two uppercase vowels at even indices in this case. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the requirement as stated in the function's description."

exp_9_HumanEval/101,HumanEval/101,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'words_string' does not correctly handle the splitting of words when they are separated by commas and spaces. The method 's.split()' only splits the string by whitespace, which means it will not separate words that are separated by commas. For example, the input 'Hi, my name is John' will return ['Hi,', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John'] instead of the expected ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']. To fix this, the function should use a regular expression or a combination of string methods to handle both commas and spaces."

For example, when testing the case choose_num(33, 12354), the function should return 12354, which is correct. However, in the case of choose_num(6, 29), the function should return 28, which is also correct. The issue arises in cases where x is odd and y is even, or both are odd, where the logic does not consistently find the largest even number. The function fails to return the correct result for certain ranges, particularly when x is greater than y and both are odd or when x is odd and y is even. Thus, the implementation does not cover all scenarios correctly."
exp_9_HumanEval/103,HumanEval/103,False,INCORRECT,"The function rounded_avg is intended to compute the average of all integers from n to m, but it only calculates the average of n and m, which is incorrect. The average should be calculated as the sum of all integers from n to m divided by the count of those integers. For example, rounded_avg(1, 5) should compute the average of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which is 3, and return '0b11'. However, the implementation only computes (n + m) / 2, which gives 3 for (1, 5) but would yield incorrect results for other ranges. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that expect results based on the correct average of the entire range, not just the endpoints."

The line 'any(j % 2 == 0 for j in str(i))' is attempting to check if any character in the string representation of the number is even, but it should be checking the integer value of each digit instead. This leads to incorrect results. For example, the number '152' contains the digit '2', which is even, but the current implementation will not correctly identify that '1', '5', and '2' are digits of the number. Therefore, the function does not return the expected output for all test cases."

Additionally, the conversion of integers to their corresponding names is not implemented at all. Instead, the code attempts to convert integers to strings multiple times unnecessarily. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected output for the provided test cases."

The correct implementation should compute the factorial for even indices and the sum of numbers from 1 to i for odd indices. For example, for i=2, it should return 2! = 2, and for i=4, it should return 4! = 24, but the current implementation returns 1 for both cases."

Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include scenarios that may not align with the intended behavior of counting digits, particularly with negative numbers. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([-1, 11, -11]) == 1' implies that -1 should not contribute to the count, but the sum of its digits is -1, which is correctly handled. However, the overall implementation is incomplete due to the missing 'sum_digits' function."

The current logic checks if all elements in lst1 are even and if all elements in lst2 are even, which is not the requirement. The function should instead check if there are enough even numbers in lst2 to replace the odd numbers in lst1. For example, in the case of exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 4]), lst1 has three odd numbers and lst2 has three even numbers, so it should return 'YES', but the current implementation would return 'NO' because it checks if all elements in both lists are even."

For example, in the first test case, the string '1234567' contains four odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7), but the function would incorrectly return '1' instead of '4'.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the vowel is between two consonants; it only checks the immediate previous character. The test case get_closest_vowel('Above') should return 'o', but it will not be handled correctly due to the lowercase conversion.

For example, '2,3' should be interpreted as 2.3, and '5,1' should be interpreted as 5.1. The current implementation compares the values directly, which will not yield the correct results for these cases. Additionally, the function does not convert string representations of numbers into their appropriate numeric types before comparison, leading to incorrect behavior when comparing mixed types (e.g., strings and floats)."
exp_9_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_equal_to_sum_even incorrectly calculates whether a number can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. The current implementation checks if n is even and then compares n to the sum of all even numbers up to n (exclusive), which does not correctly determine if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. For example, 10 can be expressed as 2 + 2 + 2 + 4, but the function would incorrectly return False because it compares 10 to the sum of even numbers up to 10, which is 20. Therefore, the assertions in the check function will fail for some cases, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."
exp_9_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' does not correctly compute the Brazilian factorial as defined in the comments. The function only calculates the regular factorial (n!) recursively, but it does not account for the multiplication of all factorials from (n-1)! down to 1!. The correct implementation should involve a loop or recursive calls that multiply all factorials from n down to 1, which is not being done here. Therefore, the test assertions will fail for inputs greater than 1."
exp_9_HumanEval/140,HumanEval/140,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'fix_spaces' does not correctly handle the requirement to replace all consecutive spaces with a single dash ('-') when there are more than two consecutive spaces. The current implementation replaces all spaces with underscores first and then attempts to replace underscores with dashes, which does not achieve the desired behavior. For example, the input 'Example   3' should return '_Example-3', but it will not due to the incorrect order of operations and the use of underscores instead of directly handling spaces."
exp_9_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'file_name_check' does not correctly enforce all the specified conditions for a valid file name. Specifically: 1) It does not check for the maximum number of digits in the file name. 2) The check for the substring before the dot only verifies if it is alphabetic, but it should also ensure that it starts with a letter and is not empty. 3) The function does not handle the case where there are more than three digits correctly. The test cases reveal that some valid cases are incorrectly marked as invalid, and vice versa."
exp_9_HumanEval/142,HumanEval/142,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the comments. Specifically, the function squares the integer at index `i` if `i` is a multiple of 3, and it cubes the integer at index `i` if `i` is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. However, the current implementation does not account for the precedence of these conditions correctly. For example, if an index is both a multiple of 3 and 4 (like index 0), it will only square the value, ignoring the cube condition. Additionally, the test case `assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030` fails because the expected output is incorrect based on the function's logic. The function needs to be revised to ensure that both conditions are checked properly and that the correct transformations are applied."
exp_9_HumanEval/143,HumanEval/143,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly handle the requirement to return words whose lengths are prime numbers. The function is missing the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is essential for determining if the length of each word is prime. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the output string is constructed without spaces between the words, which violates the requirement to maintain the original order and spacing of the words. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_9_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' is incorrect because it does not properly evaluate whether the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The condition 'if x_num * n_den == x_den * n_num' checks for equality of cross products, which is not the correct approach to determine if the product of the fractions is a whole number. Instead, the function should multiply the fractions and check if the result is an integer. For example, 'simplify(""1/5"", ""5/1"")' should return True, but the implementation does not correctly handle the multiplication of fractions."
exp_9_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation does not maintain the original order of elements with the same sum of digits. The sort function in Python is stable, meaning it preserves the order of equal elements, but the key used for sorting (the sum of digits) does not account for the original indices when the sums are equal. Therefore, the output may not match the expected results for cases where multiple numbers have the same digit sum."
exp_9_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' does not correctly check if both the first and last digits of a number are odd. The current logic only checks the last digit (using 'num % 10') and the second last digit (using 'num // 10'), which does not guarantee that the first digit is odd. For example, the number 21 would pass the last digit check but fail the first digit check, yet it is not correctly handled in the current implementation. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_9_HumanEval/147,HumanEval/147,False,INCORRECT,"The provided function 'get_max_triples' is incomplete and does not contain any implementation logic to compute the required triples. The function only has a docstring and lacks the necessary code to generate the array 'a' and count the valid triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) such that their sum is a multiple of 3. Therefore, it cannot pass the assertions in the 'check' function."
exp_9_HumanEval/148,HumanEval/148,False,INCORRECT,"The function implementation does not correctly handle the extraction of planets between the two given planets. The slicing operation 'planets[planet1:planet2]' does not work as intended because 'planets' is not defined as a list or dictionary that allows for such slicing. Additionally, the order of the planets is not taken into account when determining the range between 'planet1' and 'planet2'. The function should first determine the indices of 'planet1' and 'planet2' in a predefined list of planets, then return the planets that fall between those indices. Furthermore, the test case 'candidate(""Neptune"", ""Venus"")' is expected to return ('Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus'), but the current implementation would not handle this correctly due to the incorrect slicing logic."
exp_9_HumanEval/149,HumanEval/149,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not sort the list alphabetically when two strings have the same length. The requirement states that if two words have the same length, they should be sorted alphabetically. The current implementation only sorts by length and does not account for alphabetical order. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate(['school', 'AI', 'asdf', 'b'])', the expected output is ['AI', 'asdf', 'school'], but the function will return ['AI', 'asdf', 'school'] which is correct. However, in the case of 'assert candidate(['aaaa', 'bbbb', 'dd', 'cc'])', the expected output is ['cc', 'dd', 'aaaa', 'bbbb'], but the function will return ['cc', 'dd', 'aaaa', 'bbbb'] which is correct. The function fails to handle cases where the alphabetical order is necessary when lengths are the same."
exp_9_HumanEval/150,HumanEval/150,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function x_or_y does not correctly determine if n is a prime number. The current logic only checks if n is even (n % 2 == 0) to return x, which is incorrect. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the function should include a proper prime-checking algorithm to evaluate n correctly. As a result, the assertions in the check function may not yield the expected results for all cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/151,HumanEval/151,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'double_the_difference' does not correctly handle the requirements specified in the docstring. Specifically, the function is supposed to return the sum of squares of odd integers from the list, while ignoring negative numbers and non-integers. However, the current implementation filters the list to include only positive odd integers, which is correct, but it does not account for the fact that it should also ignore non-integer values. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function reveal that the implementation fails to return the expected results for certain inputs, such as 'candidate([0.2, 3, 5])' which should return 34 but does not due to the filtering logic. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_9_HumanEval/152,HumanEval/152,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'compare' function does not correctly calculate the absolute difference between the game scores and the guesses. The function currently returns the absolute difference only for the first element of the arrays, as it uses 'abs(game[i]-guess[i])' but does not iterate through all indices correctly. The correct implementation should return a list of absolute differences for all corresponding elements in the 'game' and 'guess' arrays. Therefore, the test cases will fail for inputs where the lengths of the arrays are greater than 1."
exp_9_HumanEval/153,HumanEval/153,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly handle the case where the strongest extension has a strength of zero or negative. The initial value of 'strongest_extension_strength' is set to 0, which means that any extension with a strength of 0 or less will not be considered, even if it is the only extension available. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where multiple extensions have the same strength; it should return the first one in the list, but the current logic does not ensure this when the strength is equal. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct strongest extension in certain cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/154,HumanEval/154,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'cycpattern_check' is intended to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word. However, the implementation only checks for the exact substring and its reverse, which does not account for all possible rotations of the second word. For example, the rotation 'ell' of 'hello' is correctly identified, but the function fails to check other rotations like 'llohe', 'lohel', etc. Additionally, the test cases in the 'check' function do not align with the expected behavior of the original function description, leading to further discrepancies. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_9_HumanEval/155,HumanEval/155,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle negative numbers and the digit '0'. When the input is negative, the '-' sign is included in the string representation, which leads to an error when trying to convert it to an integer for the modulus operation. Additionally, the digit '0' is even, so it should be counted as an even digit, which is correctly handled in the test case for '0', but the function does not account for the negative sign in other cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/156,HumanEval/156,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'int_to_mini_roman' is not implemented, as indicated by the 'pass' statement. Therefore, it cannot produce any output or return the expected Roman numeral strings. The test assertions in the 'check' function will fail because there is no logic to convert integers to Roman numerals. The function needs to be properly implemented to evaluate its correctness."
exp_9_HumanEval/157,HumanEval/157,False,INCORRECT,"The function right_angle_triangle only checks if a^2 + b^2 equals c^2, which assumes that c is the longest side. However, in a triangle, any of the three sides can be the longest. Therefore, the function should check all combinations of the sides to determine if any combination satisfies the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2). The current implementation will fail for cases where the longest side is not passed as the third argument."
exp_9_HumanEval/158,HumanEval/158,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_max' does not correctly fulfill the requirements outlined in the comments. The function is supposed to return the word with the maximum number of unique characters, but it only checks the length of the words instead of the count of unique characters. Additionally, it does not handle the case where multiple words have the same maximum number of unique characters; it should return the one that comes first lexicographically. Therefore, the function fails to pass the provided test cases that check for unique character counts."
exp_9_HumanEval/159,HumanEval/159,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'eat' does not correctly handle the case where the remaining carrots are not enough to satisfy the need. Specifically, the return values in the first condition are incorrect. The function should return the total eaten carrots as 'number + remaining' and the number of remaining carrots as 'remaining - (need - number)' if there are enough carrots to meet the need. The current implementation incorrectly returns 'need' as the second element instead of the actual remaining carrots. This leads to incorrect outputs for some test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/160,HumanEval/160,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'do_algebra' does not correctly handle the evaluation of the algebraic expression according to the operator precedence. Specifically, it processes the operators in the order they appear in the list without considering the correct mathematical precedence (e.g., multiplication and division should be evaluated before addition and subtraction). Additionally, the use of floor division (//) and exponentiation (**) can lead to incorrect results if not handled properly. For example, the expression '2 ** 3 * 4' should be evaluated as '8 * 4' resulting in 32, but the current implementation would yield 8 due to the order of operations being ignored. The test cases also reveal that the implementation fails to produce the expected results for certain inputs."
exp_9_HumanEval/161,HumanEval/161,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'solve' does not correctly handle the requirement that if the string contains no letters, the string should be reversed. The current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters present. For example, '1234' should return '4321', which is handled correctly, but if the input were to be a string with no letters, such as '!!!', it would not reverse the string as required."
exp_9_HumanEval/162,HumanEval/162,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'string_to_md5' is missing an import statement for the 'hashlib' module, which is necessary for generating the MD5 hash. Without this import, the function will raise a NameError when it tries to call 'hashlib.md5'. Additionally, the test assertions include a hash for 'A B C' and 'password' that are not correct according to the MD5 hashing algorithm. Therefore, the implementation and the test cases are both flawed."
exp_9_HumanEval/163,HumanEval/163,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b'. According to the function description, it should return the even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order. However, the implementation returns an empty list when 'a' is greater than 'b', which is not consistent with the requirement to return even digits in ascending order. Additionally, the test cases do not cover all scenarios, such as when 'a' and 'b' are equal and both are even or odd. The expected output for 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should be [2, 4, 6, 8] instead of an empty list."
