exp_0_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function has_close_elements contains a logical error in the condition used to check if two numbers are closer than the given threshold. The condition 'if numbers[i] + numbers[j] < threshold' is incorrect; it should instead check the absolute difference between the two numbers: 'if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold'. This leads to incorrect results for the test cases, as the current implementation does not correctly determine if any two numbers are within the specified threshold."
exp_0_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function has_close_elements contains a logical error in the condition used to check if two numbers are closer than the given threshold. The condition 'if numbers[i] + numbers[j] < threshold' is incorrect; it should be 'if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold'. The current condition checks if the sum of the two numbers is less than the threshold, which does not fulfill the requirement of checking the closeness of the numbers themselves. As a result, the function will not return the correct boolean value for the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,The implementation of the function has_close_elements is incorrect because it checks if the sum of two numbers is less than the threshold instead of checking if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than the threshold. The correct condition should be 'if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold'. This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases.
exp_0_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'separate_paren_groups' contains several issues. Firstly, the function does not correctly handle spaces in the input string, as it does not ignore them when processing the parentheses. Secondly, the logic for separating the groups of parentheses is flawed; it does not correctly identify the end of each group and instead appends incomplete strings to the 'groups' list. The use of 'is_balanced' is also problematic because it is not defined in the provided code, leading to potential runtime errors. Additionally, the final check for balance has an extra closing parenthesis, which will cause a syntax error. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring and fails the provided test assertions."
exp_0_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'truncate_number' is incorrect because the method 'number.modf()' is not a valid method for float objects in Python. Instead, the correct approach to obtain the integer and decimal parts of a float is to use 'math.modf()' from the math module. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input number is not positive, which contradicts the function's description. Therefore, the function will raise an AttributeError when called."
exp_0_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation'. This results in an increase in the balance instead of a decrease, as subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its absolute value. Therefore, the function may incorrectly report that the balance never falls below zero when it actually does."
exp_0_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is correct in calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected values for the MAD calculations in the assertions do not match the correct MAD values for the provided datasets. For example, the expected value for mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), but the assertion checks for 2.0/3.0 which is correct. However, the assertion for mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]) is incorrect as the expected value should be 2.0, not 6.0/5.0 (which is 1.2). Therefore, while the function implementation is correct, the tests are flawed, leading to an overall evaluation of INCORRECT."
exp_0_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. Specifically, the condition for appending the delimiter is flawed. The current logic appends the delimiter after every element except the last one, which leads to an extra delimiter being added at the end of the list. For example, calling intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4) results in [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4] instead of the expected [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]. This discrepancy fails the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct syntax for incrementing a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the parentheses are unbalanced, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if there are more closing parentheses than opening ones, the count could go negative, which should not happen in a valid parentheses string. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/7,HumanEval/7,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_substring' is correct in terms of filtering strings that contain the specified substring. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function are incorrect. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is incorrect because 'grunt' does not contain the substring 'run'. The correct output for this input should be an empty list, as none of the strings contain 'run'. Therefore, the overall correctness of the implementation is compromised by the incorrect test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' is incorrect because it does not handle the case of an empty list properly. The product should remain 1 when the list is empty, but the current implementation will return 0 for the product if the list is empty, as it initializes 'product' to 1 and multiplies it by the numbers in the list (which are none). Therefore, the product should not change from its initial value of 1, but the current implementation will not return the correct result for the product when the list is empty."
exp_0_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'rolling_max' function correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list. It initializes an empty list 'max_elements' and iterates through the input list 'numbers'. For each element, it checks if it is greater than the last recorded maximum (stored in 'max_elements') and appends the greater of the two to 'max_elements'. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the correctness of the implementation, as all assertions pass without errors."
exp_0_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is incorrectly implemented. The logic for finding the longest palindromic suffix is flawed. Specifically, the variable 'longest_postfix' is initialized incorrectly and the way it is updated does not correctly identify the longest palindromic suffix. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are meant to validate 'make_palindrome', but they are incorrectly checking 'is_palindrome'. The assertions should be checking the output of 'make_palindrome', which is not done here."
exp_0_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor does not handle cases where the input strings have different lengths. The XOR operation should be applied to all bits, and if one string is shorter, the remaining bits of the longer string should be included in the result as they are. For example, for inputs '111000' and '101010', the expected output should be '010010', but the current implementation will only process the first three bits, resulting in an incorrect output."
exp_0_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the provided implementation only updates 'longest_string' when it finds a string longer than the current maximum length, which means it will not return the first string in case of ties. For example, in the test case 'longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc'])', the expected output is 'yyy' since it is the first string with the maximum length of 3, but the implementation will return 'zzzz' instead."
exp_0_HumanEval/13,HumanEval/13,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the greatest_common_divisor function correctly follows the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The provided test assertions in the check function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they cover various cases and all assertions pass without errors. The function returns the expected results for the given inputs, confirming its correctness."
exp_0_HumanEval/14,HumanEval/14,True,CORRECT,"The function 'all_prefixes' correctly generates all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range from 1 to the length of the string plus one, slicing the string correctly to obtain each prefix. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness for various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_0_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers in the returned string. The join method is used without a space separator, which results in a concatenated string of numbers without spaces. For example, calling string_sequence(5) would return '012345' instead of '0 1 2 3 4 5'. This discrepancy leads to failed assertions in the check function."
exp_0_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function count_distinct_characters is incorrect because it does not correctly count distinct characters when the input string contains spaces or punctuation. The test case 'Jerry jERRY JeRRRY' is expected to return 5, but the implementation counts only the distinct letters and ignores spaces. Additionally, the test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' should return 5, but it is misleading as it suggests that the function is case insensitive, which is not properly validated in the implementation. The function should account for all characters, including spaces and punctuation, when determining distinct characters."
exp_0_HumanEval/17,HumanEval/17,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `parse_music` does not correctly parse the input string according to the specified musical notation. The function currently treats each character individually, which leads to incorrect interpretations of the notes. For example, it does not recognize 'o|' as a half note (2 beats) but instead counts 'o' and '|' separately, resulting in incorrect beat values. The correct approach would involve checking for the entire note representation (like 'o', 'o|', and '.|') rather than individual characters."
exp_0_HumanEval/18,HumanEval/18,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1' instead. Additionally, the logic for counting overlapping substrings is correct, but due to the syntax error, the function will not execute properly. Therefore, the function will not return the expected results for the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function sort_numbers is intended to sort words representing numbers from 'zero' to 'nine'. However, the sorting logic is flawed. The key function used in the sorted() method, 'key=lambda x: int(x[1:])', attempts to convert the string to an integer by slicing off the first character, which does not correspond to the intended numeric values. This will lead to incorrect sorting. For example, 'five' would be treated as 'ive', which cannot be converted to an integer, resulting in a ValueError. Additionally, the return statement is missing a space between the sorted words, leading to a concatenated string without spaces. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/20,HumanEval/20,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_closest_elements' does not correctly identify the closest elements. The nested loop checks pairs of elements but only considers pairs where the first element is smaller than the second. This leads to missing pairs that could be closer together, especially when the closest elements are equal or when the smaller number comes after the larger number in the list. For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', the closest elements are actually (5.0, 5.0), but the function would not return this because it only considers pairs where the first number is less than the second. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest numbers are equal correctly."
exp_0_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'rescale_to_unit' does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum values in the input list are the same. In such cases, the denominator (max_num - min_num) becomes zero, leading to a division by zero error. This is evident in the test case 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]', which is expected to return [1.0, 0.0] but will fail due to the division by zero. Additionally, the expected output for the test case 'assert candidate([12.0, 11.0, 15.0, 13.0, 14.0])' is incorrect; it should return [0.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75] instead of [0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75]."
exp_0_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension with 'isinstance' to check if each value is an integer, which aligns with the function's purpose. The provided test assertions also validate the function's behavior, confirming that it returns the expected results for various input scenarios."
exp_0_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_0_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is supposed to return the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself. However, the implementation has a flaw: when the divisor reaches 1, it incorrectly returns n instead of 1. For example, for n = 3, the expected output is 1, but the function will return 3. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n is less than or equal to 1 correctly, as it should return 0 or raise an error for such cases. Therefore, the function does not satisfy the requirements as described in the docstring."
exp_0_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error in the line 'i++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment 'i' would be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be 'n //= i' to ensure that 'n' remains an integer during factorization. These issues will prevent the function from executing correctly, leading to incorrect results or runtime errors."
exp_0_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once in the input list. However, the implementation only removes the first occurrence of each number and retains the rest, which does not align with the specified behavior. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4] (removing both occurrences of 2), but the implementation would return [1, 3, 4] correctly. However, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output is [1, 4, 5] (removing both occurrences of 2 and 3), but the implementation would return [1, 4, 5] incorrectly. The implementation does not correctly handle the removal of all duplicates."
exp_0_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character, applying 'upper()' to lowercase characters and 'lower()' to uppercase characters, which aligns with the function's description. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various cases, including an empty string and punctuation, and all assertions pass successfully."
exp_0_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'concatenate' function correctly concatenates a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the expected behavior of the function, including edge cases like an empty list and normal cases with multiple strings. All assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_0_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings that start with the given prefix. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx')' is incorrect because it expects the output to be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] since 'xxx' appears twice in the input list. Therefore, the test assertions do not accurately reflect the expected behavior of the function."
exp_0_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is intended to return only positive numbers from the input list. However, the second test assertion in the check function is incorrect. The expected output for the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] should be [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1] as stated, which matches the implementation. However, the first test assertion is incorrect; it expects [4, 5, 6] but the function correctly returns [4, 5, 6]. Therefore, the function is correct based on the provided assertions, but the assertions themselves contain an inconsistency. The function implementation is correct, but the test cases need to be verified for correctness."
exp_0_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_prime is missing an import statement for the math module, which is necessary for using math.sqrt. Without this import, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the test cases in the check function include duplicate assertions for the number 11, which is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the function itself."
exp_0_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function is supposed to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in 'xs', but it only calculates a specific value based on the coefficients without actually finding the root of the polynomial. The formula used in 'find_zero' assumes a specific structure of the polynomial (quadratic), which does not hold for all polynomials defined by the coefficients in 'xs'. Therefore, it does not guarantee a correct solution for polynomials of degree higher than 2 or for those that do not fit the assumed structure."
exp_0_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead, it sorts the entire list and then replaces every third index with the corresponding value from the sorted list, which is not the intended behavior. The expected behavior is to sort only the values at the indices divisible by three while keeping the other values unchanged. This discrepancy leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to remove duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the resulting unique elements. The provided test assertion confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given input.
exp_0_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function max_element is correct, but the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The second assertion checks for the maximum value in the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], which should return 124, but the provided list in the test case is incorrect as it contains 124 instead of 123. The correct maximum value for the original list should be 123, not 124."
exp_0_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function fizz_buzz contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' is correct, but due to the syntax error, the function will not run successfully. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring and will fail the assertions in the check function."
exp_0_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the values at the even indices. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted even indices to the current even index, rather than replacing all even indices with the sorted values. This results in incorrect output for the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should compare the output of 'decode_cyclic' with the original string 'str', but it incorrectly uses 'encode_cyclic'. This means that the test will always fail, as it is not verifying the decoding process. To fix this, the line 'assert candidate(encoded_str) == str' should be changed to 'assert candidate(encoded_str) == str' where 'candidate' is replaced with 'decode_cyclic'."
exp_0_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_fib' is supposed to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number found in the list of prime numbers instead of collecting all Fibonacci primes. For example, when n=6, it should return 233, but the current implementation will not reach that point correctly because it only checks the first n Fibonacci numbers and returns the first one that is prime. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence is not fully represented in the provided list, which may lead to incorrect results for larger n values. The test cases also expect results beyond the hardcoded Fibonacci numbers in the list."
exp_0_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,CORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' correctly implements the logic to check for three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. The nested loops ensure that all combinations of three distinct elements are considered.

All assertions in the 'check' function pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_0_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'car_race_collision' contains several issues. First, the use of '++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Second, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the problem statement, which states that each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left. Therefore, for n cars in each direction, the total number of collisions should be n * n (or n^2), not the conditions currently implemented. The test assertions expect the output to be n^2, but the function does not produce this result due to the incorrect logic and syntax errors."

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test is not validating the function correctly, leading to a failure in the test case."
exp_0_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,True,CORRECT,"The function pairs_sum_to_zero correctly implements the logic to check for two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

exp_0_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from decimal to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is incorrect for this purpose. The 'int(x, base)' function expects 'x' to be a string representation of a number in the specified base, not an integer. Additionally, the 'format' function with 'x' as the format specifier converts the number to hexadecimal, not to the desired base. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for the provided test cases."

The expected values for fib4(5), fib4(6), fib4(7), etc., do not match the values calculated by the function. Specifically, the function initializes the sequence with [0, 0, 2, 0], which is correct for the first four values, but the subsequent calculations do not yield the correct results for the provided test cases. For instance, fib4(6) should return 8, but the function does not produce this result. The test assertions in the check function also indicate that the expected values for fib4(8), fib4(10), and fib4(12) are incorrect based on the defined sequence. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

exp_0_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which can lead to incorrect results for large values of n due to integer overflow or excessive computation time. The test cases provided include assertions for values of n that exceed typical limits for direct computation. Specifically, the assertions 'assert candidate(30, 5) == 4' and 'assert candidate(31, 5) == 3' are not correctly handled by the current implementation, as they do not account for the modulo operation correctly when n is large. A more efficient approach would be to use modular exponentiation to avoid these issues."

The character shifting logic does not properly handle the wrap-around for characters that are at the end of the alphabet. Specifically, the calculation for the new character should account for the base character ('a') and ensure that the result stays within the bounds of lowercase letters. The decode_shift function also has a similar issue. The correct approach would involve adjusting the character codes correctly to ensure that the shift wraps around properly within the alphabet."
exp_0_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels does not correctly handle uppercase vowels. The current implementation only checks for lowercase vowels and does not account for uppercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U). For example, the test case remove_vowels('EcBOO') should return 'cB', but the function will incorrectly return 'cB' because it does not check for uppercase vowels. Additionally, the test case remove_vowels('acBAA') should return 'cB', but the function will return 'c' instead. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the function description."

However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This means that it will return True for lists that have equal consecutive elements, which is not consistent with the typical definition of monotonicity. For example, the list [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False since it is not strictly decreasing. The test case check also includes a case with equal elements, which the current implementation incorrectly considers as valid. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as stated in the function's docstring."

exp_0_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator 'i++', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because the final value of 'n' returned may not be the largest prime factor if 'n' is not reduced to 1. The function should return the last value of 'i' when 'n' is reduced to 1, which represents the largest prime factor found."
exp_0_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n is intended to sum numbers from 1 to n, and the formula used (n * (n + 1) / 2) is correct for this purpose. However, the test assertions in the check function include an assertion for candidate(6) which expects a result of 21. The correct sum from 1 to 6 is 21, which is correct, but the assertion for candidate(11) expecting 66 is incorrect; the correct sum from 1 to 11 is 66. Therefore, the test cases do not fully validate the function's correctness, leading to an overall evaluation of INCORRECT."
exp_0_HumanEval/61,HumanEval/61,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains syntax errors. Specifically, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with 'open_brackets += 1'. Additionally, 'else if' should be replaced with 'elif'. These issues will prevent the function from running correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function is incorrect. The function currently returns the coefficients of the polynomial without calculating the derivative. The derivative of a polynomial is calculated by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and reducing the power by one. For example, for the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the derivative should be calculated as follows: 3 (constant term) becomes 0, 1 (x^1) becomes 1, 2 (x^2) becomes 4, 4 (x^3) becomes 12, and 5 (x^4) becomes 20, resulting in [1, 4, 12, 20]. However, the current implementation simply returns the coefficients starting from the first index, which does not reflect the correct derivative calculation."

The base cases are defined correctly, but the calculation in the loop is incorrect. The expected values for fibfib(10) and fibfib(12) do not match the expected results based on the provided test assertions. The correct values for the FibFib sequence should be calculated as fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3), but the implementation does not adhere to this correctly for all cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error: 'count++' is not valid Python syntax. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly, as it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases provided also do not cover all edge cases, such as strings with no vowels or strings that end with 'y'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."

According to the description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits. The test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is incorrect; the correct output should be '001' but the function returns '100'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' fails because the expected output is incorrect; the correct output should be '79' but the function returns '97'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

The implementation iterates through each character in the string, checks if it is uppercase using 'isupper()', and if so, adds its ASCII value (obtained using 'ord()') to a cumulative sum. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and mixed-case strings, and all assertions pass without errors, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_0_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers are the smallest. Specifically, the logic for updating 'smallest_index' when a new smallest even number is found is flawed. The condition to check for equality with 'smallest_even' and update 'smallest_index' is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the case of the input [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2], the function would return [0, 3] instead of the correct [0, 1] because it does not prioritize the first occurrence of the smallest even number. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the smallest even number is found later in the list correctly. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'search' does not correctly check the frequency condition. The condition 'if freq > num' should be 'if freq >= num' to satisfy the requirement that the frequency must be greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. As a result, the function may return incorrect values for certain inputs, such as 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])' which should return 1 but will not due to the incorrect condition."
exp_0_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly handle the case where there are duplicate minimum or maximum values. Specifically, when the minimum or maximum value is removed from the list, if there are multiple occurrences of that value, the function will only remove one instance, potentially leading to incorrect results in subsequent iterations. For example, in the case of the input [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not produce this output due to the way it removes elements from the list. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the list has an odd number of elements correctly, as it may not alternate between minimum and maximum values as intended. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function is incorrect. The formula used to calculate the area of the triangle is not valid. The area of a triangle given its sides can be calculated using Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the method 'round' is incorrectly called on a float object; it should be 'round(area, 2)'. The test cases also indicate that the expected results for some inputs do not match the expected area calculations."
exp_0_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly check for the palindromic condition before checking the sum of the elements. If the list is not palindromic, it should return False immediately, but the current implementation checks the sum first. This could lead to incorrect results in cases where the list is unbalanced but the sum is within the weight limit. For example, will_it_fly([1, 2, 1], 5) should return True because it is balanced and the sum is 4, but it would return False due to the order of checks."
exp_0_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' contains a syntax error in the line 'left++', which should be 'left += 1'. Additionally, the logic used to calculate the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is flawed. The while loop only checks for mismatches until the midpoint, but it does not correctly count the number of changes required. The return statement does not accurately reflect the number of changes needed, as it is based on the incorrect calculation of 'mid - left'. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for the test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/74,HumanEval/74,True,INCORRECT,"The function total_match is supposed to return the list with a total number of characters less than the other list. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' fails because the total character count for both lists is equal (8 characters each), but the function is expected to return the first list in such cases. The implementation correctly returns the first list when the counts are equal, but the test case is incorrectly asserting that the second list should be returned. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test case is incorrect."
exp_0_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. However, the implementation only checks if the number is prime itself and does not account for the multiplication of three primes. The logic used in the for loop incorrectly returns False for any non-prime number without checking if it can be expressed as a product of three primes. Additionally, the test cases include numbers greater than 100, which contradicts the function's description that states 'a is less than 100'. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of the task."
exp_0_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which are the correct boolean values in Python. Secondly, the condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' does not correctly check if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. This condition will fail for many cases, such as when 'x' is not an exact power of 'n'. For example, 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' should return True, but the current implementation will not handle it correctly. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 0, which can lead to mathematical errors. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it checks if the cube root of 'a' is an integer by using the expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0'. This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for larger integers. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the implementation may yield True due to rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic. A more reliable method would be to compute the cube root using integer arithmetic and check if cubing the result gives back the original number."
exp_0_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'hex_key' contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the condition 'char.isdigit() or char.isupper() and char in ""2357ABED""' is incorrect because it does not properly check for the prime hexadecimal digits. The correct prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B, and D. The condition should be modified to check if 'char' is in the set of prime hexadecimal digits. Furthermore, the test case 'assert candidate([]) == 0' is incorrect because the function expects a string, not a list. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail to pass the provided test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'decimal_to_binary' does not correctly handle the binary representation for numbers that are not 8 bits long. The current implementation pads the binary string with leading zeros to make it 8 bits long, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', and the function returns 'db00001111db' instead of 'db1111db'. This discrepancy means that the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_0_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct. The current logic attempts to compare slices of the string incorrectly, leading to incorrect results. The loop and condition used do not ensure that every set of 3 consecutive characters are distinct from each other. For example, the string 'iopaxioi' should return False because 'ioi' contains repeating characters, but the current implementation may not catch this due to its flawed logic."
exp_0_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values at the boundary conditions. For example, the GPA of 3.7 should yield an 'A' grade, but the current implementation yields 'A+' for 4.0 and 'A' for any GPA greater than 3.7, which is correct. However, the GPA of 3.3 should yield 'A-', but the implementation incorrectly assigns 'A-' for any GPA greater than 3.3. The same issue occurs for other grades as well. The correct implementation should use '>= ' for the highest grade and '>' for the others to ensure proper grading. Additionally, the test cases do not cover all edge cases, such as the exact boundaries for each grade, which could lead to incorrect assertions."
exp_0_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' is intended to check if the length of the input string is a prime number. However, the implementation has a flaw in its prime-checking logic. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case when the string length is 2, which is a prime number. The loop iterates from 2 to string_length - 1, and for a string of length 2, it will not enter the loop at all, leading to an incorrect return value of True. Additionally, the function does not account for the case when the string length is 1, which should return False. The test cases also include assertions that expect the function to return True for strings of lengths that are prime and False for non-prime lengths, but due to the implementation error, some of these assertions will fail."
exp_0_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'starts_one_ends' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should use 'count += 1'. Additionally, the range in the for loop should start from 10**(n-1) to ensure it only counts n-digit numbers. The current implementation counts all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1, which includes numbers that are not n-digit. Therefore, the logic for counting n-digit integers that start or end with 1 is flawed."
exp_0_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input number N when expressed in binary. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the sum of the binary digits of N instead of the binary representation of the sum of the digits. For example, for N = 150, the sum of the digits (1 + 5 + 0) is 6, which in binary is '110'. The function returns '6' instead of '110'. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for cases like candidate(150) and candidate(147)."

However, in the test case 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the expected output is 122, but the function would return 5 (the element at index 1) + 7 (the element at index 3) = 12, which is incorrect. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_0_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'anti_shuffle' does not maintain the original spacing between words in the input string. When the words are sorted and joined, the spaces are lost, resulting in a concatenated string without spaces. For instance, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation returns 'Hello!!!Wdlor', which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle punctuation correctly, as it does not sort or separate them from the words. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements stated in the function's docstring."
exp_0_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'get_row' does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the function description. The current sorting logic combines two separate sorts: first by row in ascending order, and then by column in descending order. However, the requirement is to sort the coordinates by rows in ascending order and then, within each row, sort the columns in descending order. The current implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results for some test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of summing the values at the first and last indices of the array (i.e., array[0] + array[-1]), it sums the indices themselves (0 + len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior for determining the sorting order based on the sum being odd or even. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the indices is 6 (even), but the expected behavior is to sort based on the values 2 and 6, which would yield an odd sum (8) and thus should sort in ascending order instead of descending."

However, the implementation currently rotates each letter by only 2 positions. For example, the input 'hi' should return 'lm' (which is correct), but the input 'asdfghjkl' should return 'ewhjlnop' instead of 'ewhjklnop'. Additionally, the test cases provided in the check function include assertions that expect incorrect outputs based on the intended rotation. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

Specifically, when the list contains duplicate values, the logic fails to return None when there is no distinct second smallest element. For example, in the case of [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the function incorrectly returns 1 instead of None, as there is no second distinct smallest value. Additionally, the condition for updating second_smallest does not account for the case where the current smallest is equal to the second smallest, which can lead to incorrect results."

Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will cause a NameError. Secondly, the condition to check if all numbers are integers is incorrectly placed; it should be checked before evaluating the sum condition. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where any of the inputs are non-integer types correctly, as it currently only checks if the last two inputs are integers. Therefore, the function will not return the expected results for all test cases."
exp_0_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly swap the vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet.

For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5], but the implementation returns [2, 3, 5]. This is correct for this specific case, but it fails to limit the output to the first n primes in cases where n is larger than the number of primes less than n. The assertion for candidate(6) is correct, but the assertion for candidate(10) is incorrect as it expects [2,3,5,7] which is correct, but the function does not limit the output to the first n primes.

For example, in the test case exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3]), the function incorrectly returns 'YES' because it finds one even number (2) to swap with one odd number (5), but it fails to recognize that there are still two odd numbers left (7 and 3) without enough even numbers in lst2 to replace them. Therefore, the function's logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios."

Additionally, the output strings are incorrectly formatted; the expected output uses 'n' instead of 'n' in the string, and the count of odd digits is not correctly reflected in the output for the test cases provided. The logic for counting odd digits is correct, but the output formatting and the increment operation need to be fixed."
exp_0_HumanEval/114,HumanEval/114,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function minSubArraySum is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array. The nested loops create sub-arrays and calculate their sums, but the logic fails to account for the fact that the minimum sum should be derived from the smallest contiguous sub-array. The function also does not handle the case where the input array contains only positive numbers correctly, as it would return the sum of the entire array instead of the minimum single element. Additionally, the performance of this implementation is O(n^3) due to the repeated summation of sub-arrays, which is inefficient for larger arrays. A more optimal solution would involve using a single pass to track the minimum sum using a variation of Kadane's algorithm."

The current logic decrements the 'buckets' variable without resetting it for each new row, which means that once the bucket capacity is exhausted, it does not continue to count the remaining 1s in the subsequent rows. The function should keep track of the total number of times buckets are lowered across all wells, and it should reset the bucket count for each row. Additionally, the code uses 'grid.shape' which is not valid for a list of lists in Python; it should use 'len(grid)' for rows and 'len(grid[0])' for columns. Therefore, the function does not produce the correct output for the provided test cases."

In Python, the correct way to create a list of tuples would be using a list comprehension or the 'map' function. Additionally, the sorting criteria in the test assertions do not match the expected behavior described in the function's docstring. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the assertion in the test case shows an incorrect expected output of [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements specified in the comments."

The loop iterates from the end of the word to the beginning, but when it finds a consonant at index i, it checks the character at index i + 1, which is out of bounds when i is the last index. Additionally, it incorrectly checks for vowels after finding two consonants, which does not align with the requirement to find a vowel that stands between two consonants. The function should instead check for a vowel at index i - 1 when two consonants are found at indices i and i + 1. This leads to incorrect results for several test cases."

The checks only consider specific cases where the first string starts with '(' and the second ends with ')' or vice versa. However, it fails to account for cases where the total number of opening and closing parentheses might still be balanced but not in the correct order. For example, the input ['(()(())', '())())'] should return 'No', but the function does not handle such cases correctly. Additionally, the function does not properly handle cases where both strings are empty or contain invalid characters, as it only checks for empty strings but does not validate the characters themselves."

It allows for 29 days in February without checking for leap years, which means it could incorrectly return True for dates like '02-29-2021', which is invalid since 2021 is not a leap year. Additionally, the checks for the number of days in months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are redundant since they are already covered by the general check for days being between 1 and 31. The function also does not handle the case where the day is 0 or negative correctly, as it only checks for the upper limit of days. Therefore, the implementation does not fully satisfy the requirements outlined in the comments."

The first issue is that the function does not properly check for the presence of commas after checking for whitespace. If there are no words after splitting by whitespace, it should split by commas, but the current implementation will not reach that point correctly. Additionally, the function returns a list of ASCII values of lowercase letters instead of the count of lowercase letters with odd positions in the alphabet. The final return statement should return the count of those letters instead of the list of their ASCII values. The test cases also expect a return value of 3 for 'abcdef', but the current implementation will return a list instead. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

In this case, it should return 'NO' if 'start' is not prime, but it incorrectly checks for 'is_prime(start)' instead of checking the length of the intersection. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the intervals do not intersect correctly, as it only checks if 'start > end' and does not account for the case where 'start' equals 'end'. Therefore, the function does not produce the correct results for all test cases."

Specifically, the product of signs should be 0 if any number in the array is 0, which would make the entire product 0. However, the current implementation uses 'reduce' to multiply the signs, which will not yield the correct result when 0 is present. For example, 'prod_signs([0, 1])' should return 0, but the product of signs is calculated as 0, leading to a final result of 0, which is correct. However, in other cases, such as 'prod_signs([-1, 1, -1, 1])', the product of signs is correctly calculated as 1, but the sum of magnitudes is not multiplied correctly when there are negative signs. The test case 'prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1])' should return -10, but it does not due to the incorrect handling of signs. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."

Additionally, the expected outputs in the test cases do not match the expected values based on the defined Tribonacci sequence. For example, 'tri(3)' should yield [1, 3, 2, 8], but the implementation does not produce the correct sequence due to the incorrect handling of odd indices."

The variable 'nested' is set to True when an opening bracket is found, but it is reset to False whenever a closing bracket is encountered, which does not accurately reflect whether there is a nested structure. For example, in the input '[[[[]]]]', the function would incorrectly return False because it resets 'nested' to False after the first closing bracket.

Secondly, the method to square the elements and sum them is also incorrect. The code uses 'squared_lst = rounded_lst.map { $0 * $0 }', which is not valid Python syntax. Instead, it should use a list comprehension or 'map' to square the elements. Lastly, the final return statement 'return squared_lst.sum()' is incorrect as 'sum()' is a built-in function and should be called directly on the list, not on a variable.

However, the test case 'assert candidate([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10])==2' is incorrect because the expected output should be 1 (the index of the element 4), not 2.

The function should return the largest negative integer and None for the smallest positive integer in such cases. For example, the input [-1, -3, -5, -6] should return (-1, None) but the test cases incorrectly expect (None, None). Therefore, the implementation is not aligned with the expected behavior as described."

Secondly, the function does not correctly handle the case where the substring before the dot is empty, as it does not check the length of the substring before the dot after splitting. Additionally, the function does not correctly enforce the maximum of three digits rule, as it allows for more than three digits if they are not counted consecutively.

All assertions pass, confirming the function's correctness."
exp_0_HumanEval/159,HumanEval/159,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'eat' does not correctly handle the case where the total number of eaten carrots after meals is calculated. Specifically, the total number of eaten carrots should be the initial number of eaten carrots plus the number of carrots eaten from the remaining stock, which is the minimum of 'need' and 'remaining'. The current implementation incorrectly sums 'number' and 'remaining' directly, which leads to incorrect results for certain test cases. For example, in the case of 'eat(2, 11, 5)', the expected output is [7, 0] because the rabbit can eat all 5 remaining carrots, but the function incorrectly calculates the total as 7 (2 + 5) without considering the need. The correct logic should be: if remaining is less than need, eat all remaining and add to number, otherwise eat need carrots and add to number."

In the provided example, the expression '2 + 3 * 4 - 5' should be evaluated as '2 + (3 * 4) - 5', which equals 9. However, the current implementation evaluates it from left to right without considering precedence, which would yield a different result. Additionally, the test case 'candidate(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5])' evaluates to 37, which is incorrect as it does not respect the order of operations. The implementation needs to be revised to correctly handle operator precedence."

According to the problem statement, if there are no letters in the string, the function should return the string reversed. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correct, but the implementation does not account for the requirement when there are no letters. The test cases also include cases that would fail if they contained no letters, such as '1234', which is handled correctly, but the function lacks the logic to handle the specified condition of reversing the entire string when no letters are present."

According to the function description, it should return the even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, which implies that the function should handle both cases (a < b and a > b). However, the current implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without considering the order of the inputs. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return [2, 4, 6, 8] but it will not produce any output because the range will be invalid. Additionally, the test cases do not cover all edge cases, such as when 'a' is equal to 'b' or when both are even or odd. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance, which is incorrect. It should add the absolute value of the operation to the balance instead. For example, if the operation is -4, the balance should decrease by 4, not increase. This leads to incorrect results in certain test cases, such as 'below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])' which should return True, but the implementation does not correctly reflect the balance changes."

However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD calculations. For example, the expected result for mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), but the assertion checks for 2.0/3.0, which is correct. However, the assertion for mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]) is correct as it should return 1.0. The last assertion for mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]) is incorrect as it expects 6.0/5.0 (1.2), but the correct MAD is 1.2. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the tests do not validate it properly."

But the test case 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run')' expects the output to be ['grunt', 'prune'], which is incorrect because 'grunt' does not contain 'run'. The function does not correctly filter based on the substring presence in all cases, leading to an incorrect evaluation."

Specifically, if the input list contains a zero, the product should be zero, but the current implementation will return a product of 0 only if the list contains a zero as the last element. For example, 'sum_product([100, 0])' should return (100, 0), which is correct, but 'sum_product([1, 2, 0])' would incorrectly return (3, 0) instead of (3, 0). The product should be calculated as 0 whenever any number in the list is 0, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly."

The variable 'longest_postfix' is incorrectly initialized to the reverse of the entire string, which does not correctly represent the longest palindromic suffix. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are incorrectly testing 'is_palindrome' instead of 'make_palindrome'. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements as described."

The function currently treats 'o', '|', and '.' as individual characters, but it fails to recognize 'o|' as a half note and instead adds 2 beats for the '|' character separately. This leads to incorrect results for inputs that include 'o|'. For example, the input 'o| o| .| .| o o' should return [4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4], but the current implementation will not produce this result due to the incorrect handling of the '|' character. The function needs to be modified to correctly parse the notes as whole notes, half notes, and quarter notes based on the combined characters."

Therefore, the function will not return the expected results as described in the docstring and the test assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the input numbers because it sorts them as strings rather than by their numeric values. For example, 'three', 'five', and 'nine' are sorted lexicographically, resulting in 'five three nine' instead of the expected 'three five nine'.

For example, in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', the closest numbers are actually 5.0 and 5.9, but the function will not return them correctly due to the ordering condition. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest numbers are equal properly, as it only returns pairs where the first number is less than the second. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the function description."

However, the implementation incorrectly returns n when the divisor is less than or equal to 1. This is not the expected behavior. For example, for n = 3, the expected output is 1, but the function will return 3 instead. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n is less than or equal to 1 correctly, as it should return 0 or indicate that there are no divisors. The test cases in the check function reveal these issues, as the assertions for inputs like 3 and 7 will fail."

This can lead to incorrect results for large values of n, as the intermediate result of 2^n can exceed the limits of standard integer representation and cause overflow. The test cases check for correctness, and while some pass, others (especially those with larger n) may not yield the expected results due to this overflow issue. A correct implementation should use modular exponentiation to avoid this problem."
exp_1_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The 'decode_shift' function is incorrectly implemented. The encoding shifts characters by 5 positions forward in the alphabet, but the decoding attempts to shift them back by 5 positions using an incorrect formula. The correct decoding formula should be: chr(((ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5) % 26) + ord('a')). This ensures that the characters wrap around correctly when decoding. As a result, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for encoded strings."
exp_1_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is intended to remove all vowels from the input string, but it incorrectly handles the case of characters that are not vowels. The implementation checks if a character is alphabetic and not a vowel before adding it to the result. This means that non-alphabetic characters (like digits or punctuation) would be ignored entirely, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the test case remove_vowels('zbcd') should return 'zbcd', which is correct, but the function does not handle cases with non-alphabetic characters properly. Additionally, the test case remove_vowels('fedcba') should return 'fdcb', but the function will return 'fdcb' as expected. However, the function fails to account for the inclusion of non-alphabetic characters in the output, which is a flaw in the implementation."

This means it will return True for strings that have the same characters in different quantities, which is not the intended behavior. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return False, which is correct, but the function would return True for 'abcd' and 'dddddddabc' because they contain the same characters, albeit in different counts. The test cases provided do not align with the function's implementation."
exp_1_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function is correct for the provided test cases, but it is inefficient for larger values of n due to its exponential time complexity. The function uses recursion without memoization, leading to repeated calculations. While the test assertions for n=10, n=1, and n=8 pass, the additional assertions for n=11 and n=12 are not included in the original function's documentation and may not be verified by the implementation. Thus, the function does not meet the efficiency standards expected for larger Fibonacci numbers."

exp_1_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This allows for flat sections in the list (e.g., repeated elements) to be considered as monotonically increasing or decreasing, which is not typically the definition of monotonicity. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] returns True, but it should return False because it is not strictly decreasing. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."

It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case when 'n' is reduced to a prime factor; it should return the last value of 'n' after the loop, which may not be the largest prime factor if 'n' is divisible by a larger prime. The test cases in the 'check' function also include inputs that do not align with the function's description, as they assume 'n' is not a prime and greater than 1, which is not guaranteed in the assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n is intended to sum numbers from 1 to n, and the implementation correctly uses the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 for this purpose. However, the test assertions in the check function include an assertion for candidate(6) which is expected to return 21. This is incorrect because the correct sum from 1 to 6 is 21, which is consistent with the implementation. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test case is misleading as it does not cover the expected output for all inputs correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/61,HumanEval/61,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains syntax errors that prevent it from running correctly. Specifically, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be 'open_brackets += 1'. Additionally, the 'else if' statement should be 'elif', and the braces '{}' used for the 'if' block are incorrect; Python uses indentation instead. These issues will cause the function to raise syntax errors, making it impossible to evaluate its correctness based on the provided test assertions."
exp_1_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial without calculating the actual derivative. The derivative of a polynomial is obtained by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and then reducing the power by one. For example, for the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the correct derivative should be [1*1, 2*2, 3*4, 4*5] which results in [1, 4, 12, 20]. However, the current implementation simply returns the coefficients starting from the first index, which does not yield the correct derivative values. The test cases provided also highlight this issue, as the expected outputs do not match the actual outputs from the current implementation."

Specifically, the base cases for fibfib(0) and fibfib(1) should return 0, and fibfib(2) should return 1, which is correct. However, the function incorrectly returns 'n' for n < 3 instead of the expected values. Additionally, the test assertions include checks for fibfib(10), fibfib(12), and fibfib(14) which are not defined in the initial comments, leading to potential confusion about the expected outputs. The correct implementation should ensure that the base cases are handled properly and that the sequence is computed accurately."

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the condition that 'y' is only considered a vowel when it is at the end of the word. The test cases provided in the 'check' function also do not cover all possible scenarios, such as words ending with 'y' or words with mixed case. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the comments."
exp_1_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'circular_shift' does not correctly handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits. According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits, but it does not account for the fact that a shift greater than the length should also return the digits reversed. For example, 'circular_shift(100, 2)' should return '001' as expected, but 'circular_shift(11, 101)' should return '11' as expected, which is correct. However, the function does not handle cases where the shift is greater than the number of digits correctly, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios."

exp_1_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'fruit_distribution' is incorrect because it does not properly extract the number of apples and oranges from the input string. The lines that attempt to split and strip the string only retrieve the first and second words, which do not correspond to the actual counts of apples and oranges. Instead, it should parse the string to correctly extract both numbers. As a result, the function will not return the correct number of mangoes in the basket for the provided test cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, when the smallest even value is found, the function updates the index only if the current index is less than the previously stored index. However, it does not account for the case where the smallest even value is found again at a later index, which could also be the same smallest value. The logic should ensure that the first occurrence of the smallest even number is always retained. This leads to incorrect results in some test cases, such as 'assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4, 8]) == [4, 1]' where the expected output is not produced correctly."
exp_1_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'search' does not correctly check the frequency condition. The condition 'if freq > num' should be 'if freq >= num' to satisfy the requirement that the frequency must be greater than or equal to the integer itself. As a result, the function may return incorrect values for certain inputs, such as 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])' which should return 1 but will not due to the incorrect condition."
exp_1_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'strange_sort_list' does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the minimum or maximum values. The function removes the minimum and maximum values from the list, which can lead to incorrect results when the same value appears multiple times. For example, in the case of the input [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not produce this result because it removes the first occurrence of -5 and 5, leading to incorrect ordering. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the list has an odd number of elements correctly, as it may end up skipping elements. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_1_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not yield the correct area for a triangle. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its three sides (a, b, c) is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct area for valid triangles."
exp_1_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the function description, an empty list should return True, but the current implementation returns True without checking if the sum is less than or equal to w. Additionally, the function does not check for the balance condition (palindrome) before returning True. The order of checks should ensure that the list is balanced and the sum is within the weight limit before returning True. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the specified requirements."
exp_1_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The logic used to determine 'min_changes' is flawed. The function initializes 'min_changes' to the length of the array, which is incorrect. Instead, it should count the number of mismatches between the elements from the start and end of the array. The current implementation only decrements 'min_changes' for each mismatch found, which does not yield the correct result. For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6], the correct number of changes should be 4, but the function would return 3 due to the incorrect logic. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_1_HumanEval/74,HumanEval/74,True,INCORRECT,"The function total_match does not handle the case where one list is empty and the other is not correctly. According to the function description, if one list is empty, it should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in such cases, which is incorrect. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is incorrect because the total character count of the second list is greater than the first, so the expected return should be ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']."
exp_1_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_multiply_prime' does not correctly implement the logic to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. The current implementation only checks if the number is prime itself, returning True for prime numbers and False for composite numbers. This is not aligned with the requirement of checking for the multiplication of three primes. For example, the function incorrectly returns True for 8 (which is 2 * 2 * 2, not three distinct primes) and False for 30 (which is indeed the product of three primes: 2, 3, and 5). Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(125) == True' is incorrect since 125 is not the product of three primes. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the specified requirements."
exp_1_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which are the correct boolean values in Python. Secondly, the condition 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' does not correctly determine if 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. For example, for 'is_simple_power(9, 3)', the logarithm calculation would yield 2, and the comparison would incorrectly return True, as 3**2 equals 9. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'n' is less than or equal to 1 properly, which can lead to incorrect results. The test cases also include assertions that would fail based on the incorrect logic in the function."
exp_1_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it uses the expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' to determine if 'a' is a perfect cube. This method can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. For example, when 'a' is a large number, the result of 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0)' may not be an exact integer, causing the modulo operation to yield incorrect results. A more reliable approach would be to calculate the cube root, round it to the nearest integer, and then check if cubing that integer returns the original number. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(1729) == False' is incorrect; 1729 is not a perfect cube, but the assertion checks against 1728, which is a perfect cube (12^3). This discrepancy further indicates that the tests are not accurately validating the function's correctness."

Additionally, the condition 'if char in ""2357ABED""' is incorrect because it does not include 'D' (which represents decimal 13) and excludes 'A' (which is not prime). The correct set of characters to check should be '2357BD' (where 'B' is 11 and 'D' is 13). Therefore, the function will not return the correct counts for the provided test cases."
exp_1_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the binary representation of numbers that require more than 8 bits. The implementation pads the binary string to 8 bits with leading zeros, which is not consistent with the expected output for all decimal inputs. For example, decimal_to_binary(103) should return 'db1100111db', but the function will incorrectly return 'db001100111db' due to the padding logic. The padding should only be applied if the binary representation is less than 8 bits long, or it should not be applied at all, as the examples do not indicate a fixed bit length."
exp_1_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check if every 3 consecutive letters are distinct. The current logic only checks if the substring of length 3 starting from index j is not equal to the substring starting from index j + 3, which does not ensure that all 3 consecutive characters are distinct. For example, the string 'abcabc' would incorrectly return True, as it checks only pairs of 3-character segments rather than ensuring that all characters in each segment are distinct. The correct approach should involve checking each triplet of characters in the string to ensure they are all different."

The test case 'assert candidate([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) == ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']' fails because the GPA of 3 should return 'B+' instead of 'B'. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for all test cases."

Specifically, the loop that checks for factors of `string_length` runs from 2 to `string_length - 1`, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results. For example, it will incorrectly return True for non-prime lengths like 4 (since 4 % 2 == 0). Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `string_length` is 2 correctly, as it should return True for 2, which is a prime number. The test cases also include assertions that expect the function to return True for lengths that are not prime, indicating that the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Therefore, the expected outputs in the assertions do not match the actual outputs produced by the function."
exp_1_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the current implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case add([4, 88]), the function returns 88, which is correct, but in add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122]), it returns 122, which is incorrect because the element at index 5 (122) is even, but the element at index 1 (5) is not even and should not be included in the sum.

It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the actual values in the array. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the first index value is 2 and the last index value is 6, which sums to 8 (even), but the function checks the sum of indices (0 + 6 = 6, even) and sorts in descending order, which is incorrect.

However, multiply(148, 412) should return 16, but the unit digits are 8 and 2, which multiply to 16, so this case is also correct. The issue arises with the test case multiply(14, -15), which should return 20, but the unit digits are 4 and 5, which multiply to 20, making this case correct as well. The function fails to account for negative numbers correctly in the context of the problem statement, as the unit digit of -15 is 5. The assertion for multiply(76, 67) is incorrect because the unit digits are 6 and 7, which multiply to 42, making this case correct.

For example, closest_integer('-15.5') should return -16, but the current implementation will incorrectly return -15. Additionally, the check for the fractional part being greater than 0.0 does not account for the case when it is exactly 0.5, leading to incorrect results in such cases."

Specifically, it uses 'i * 2 + 3' for even 'n' and 'i * 2 + 2' for odd 'n', which does not yield the correct next odd or even number. For example, when 'n' is 4, the expected output is [4, 6, 8, 10], but the function will produce [4, 3, 5, 7] instead. This discrepancy leads to failing assertions in the test cases."

Specifically, the use of 'maxOf' and 'minOf' is incorrect as these functions are not defined in the provided code. The correct approach should use Python's built-in 'max' and 'min' functions. Additionally, the range function is incorrectly defined; it should iterate from 'max(x, y)' down to 'min(x, y) - 1' to include the lower bound. The logic for finding the largest even number is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case when x is greater than y. Therefore, the function will not return the expected results for all test cases."

Firstly, the method 'Integer.toBinaryString' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with 'bin()' to convert an integer to its binary representation. Secondly, the rounding of the average is incorrectly implemented. The average should be rounded using Python's built-in 'round()' function, not 'avg.roundToInt()'. Lastly, the test cases in the 'check' function include assertions that are not covered by the implementation, such as 'candidate(7, 13)' which is expected to return '0b1010' but is not correctly calculated in the function. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements outlined in the function description."

However, 'd' is a character (string) when iterating over 'str(num)', and thus the modulo operation will raise a TypeError. The correct approach would be to convert 'd' back to an integer before performing the modulo operation. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which should return an empty list as well.

The expected behavior is to ignore -1 and 55 entirely, leading to an empty list after filtering, which contradicts the expected output of ['One'].

Additionally, the way to extract digits from a number is incorrect; the code attempts to call 'digits()' on a string, which is not valid. The logic for handling negative numbers is also flawed, as it only checks the last digit instead of the sum of all digits. Finally, the test cases do not cover all edge cases, such as negative numbers with non-zero sums of digits. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the required functionality."

The variable 'buckets' is initialized to the capacity of a single bucket and decremented each time a water unit (1) is found in the grid. However, once 'buckets' reaches zero, the function breaks out of the inner loop, which means it does not continue to count the remaining water units in the current row or subsequent rows. This leads to an incorrect count of the total number of times buckets are lowered. For example, in the test case with input '[[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]' and capacity 2, the expected output is 4, but the function would return 2 because it stops counting after using the first two buckets. The logic should instead keep track of the total number of water units and divide by the bucket capacity to determine the total number of times buckets need to be lowered."

Additionally, the expected output in the test cases does not match the intended behavior described in the function's docstring. For instance, the expected output for `sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])` should be `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]` based on the number of ones in binary representation, but the provided implementation does not achieve this.

Instead, it should look for a vowel that is preceded by two consonants. Additionally, the function converts the entire word to uppercase, which causes it to lose the case sensitivity required by the problem statement. The test case 'assert candidate(""full"") == ""u""' fails because the function will return an empty string instead of 'u' due to the incorrect logic. The function does not correctly identify the closest vowel between two consonants from the right side of the word."

Firstly, the variables 'count_open' and 'count_close' are used without being initialized, which will lead to a runtime error. Secondly, the logic for checking if the concatenated strings can form a good string is flawed. The function only checks if the counts of '(' and ')' are equal in the first string, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid combination can be formed. The function should instead check the balance of parentheses when considering both strings together, regardless of their order.

Additionally, the function does not return the count of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet correctly; it returns a list of their ASCII values instead of the count.

The product of signs should be a single value (1, -1, or 0) based on the signs of all numbers in the array, not an element-wise multiplication. For example, in the case of [1, 2, 2, -4], the product of signs should be -1 (since there is one negative number), but the implementation incorrectly computes the sum as if it were multiplying each magnitude by its corresponding sign. This leads to incorrect results for several test cases."

The test cases also indicate that the outputs are incorrect, as they do not match the expected results. For example, the expected output for the input grid [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] with k = 3 is [1, 2, 1], but the implementation does not ensure that the path is constructed correctly to achieve this result."

Additionally, the recurrence relation for odd n is incorrectly implemented, leading to incorrect results for larger values of n.

Firstly, the method 'filter' is not a valid method for lists in Python; it should be replaced with a list comprehension or the 'filter' function. Secondly, the sorting logic is incorrect. The function first sorts by length and then sorts alphabetically, which will not maintain the length-based sorting as required. The correct approach should be to sort by length first and then by the string itself in a single sorting operation. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to filter out words based on their lengths. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_1_HumanEval/150,HumanEval/150,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'x_or_y' relies on an undefined function 'is_prime' to determine if 'n' is a prime number. Without the implementation of 'is_prime', the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the behavior for the input '1' is incorrect; '1' is not a prime number, so it should return 'y', which is '0' in this case, but the function does not handle this correctly. Therefore, the implementation is not complete and does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_1_HumanEval/151,HumanEval/151,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'double_the_difference' does not correctly implement the logic described in the docstring. Specifically, it fails to ignore non-integer numbers and does not handle negative integers correctly. The function only checks if a number is odd (using 'num % 2 == 1') and adds its square to the result, but it does not account for the requirement to ignore negative numbers or non-integers. For example, the test case 'assert candidate([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]) == 0' would pass, but the function does not explicitly check for non-integers. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([5, 4]) == 25' is incorrect because it should return 25 only for the odd number 5, while the current implementation would return 25 correctly but not for the right reasons. The logic for summing squares of odd integers is not correctly implemented."
exp_1_HumanEval/152,HumanEval/152,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'compare' is mostly correct, but it fails to handle negative guesses properly. The test case 'compare([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])' expects the output to be [2,4,6], which is correct, but the assertion in the check function is incorrect. The expected output for this test case should actually be [2,4,6] based on the absolute differences, which the function does calculate correctly. However, the test case 'compare([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])' expects an output of [2,0,0,1], but the actual output would be [2,0,0,1], which is correct. The issue lies in the test case descriptions and not in the function itself. Therefore, the overall evaluation is that the function is correct, but the test cases are misleading."
exp_1_HumanEval/153,HumanEval/153,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function Strongest_Extension has a logical flaw in how it determines the strongest extension. The function does not correctly handle the case where two extensions have the same strength; it compares the extensions lexicographically instead of maintaining the first one encountered in the list. This can lead to incorrect results when the first extension with the maximum strength is not selected. For example, in the test case 'Watashi', ['tEN', 'niNE', 'eIGHt8OKe'], both 'tEN' and 'niNE' have the same strength of 0, but 'eIGHt8OKe' has a strength of 3, which is the strongest. The implementation would incorrectly select 'niNE' instead of 'eIGHt8OKe'. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described."
exp_1_HumanEval/154,HumanEval/154,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'cycpattern_check' is supposed to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word or its reverse is in the first word, which does not account for all possible rotations of the second word. For example, the test case 'cycpattern_check(""efef"",""fee"")' should return True because 'fee' is a rotation of 'efef', but the current implementation will return False. Thus, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of the function description."

These issues will lead to runtime errors and incorrect results."

Specifically, it does not handle the cases for numbers less than 5 correctly, and it does not account for the subtractive notation used in Roman numerals (e.g., 4 should be 'iv', but the code does not handle this case). Additionally, the test case for 251 is expected to return 'cccli', but the implementation would return an incorrect result. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_1_HumanEval/157,HumanEval/157,False,INCORRECT,"The function right_angle_triangle only checks if a^2 + b^2 equals c^2, assuming c is the longest side. However, it does not account for the possibility that a or b could be the longest side. To correctly determine if the triangle is a right-angled triangle, the function should first identify the longest side and then check the Pythagorean theorem condition for all combinations of the sides. For example, for the input (10, 6, 8), the longest side is 10, and the function incorrectly returns True instead of False."
exp_1_HumanEval/158,HumanEval/158,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'find_max' correctly identifies the word with the maximum number of unique characters and handles ties by returning the lexicographically first word.

Specifically, the line 'return [total, remaining - total]' does not account for the scenario where the total number of carrots eaten exceeds the remaining carrots. In such cases, the remaining carrots should be set to zero, not calculated as 'remaining - total'. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the total exceeds the available remaining carrots."
exp_1_HumanEval/160,HumanEval/160,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'do_algebra' does not correctly handle operator precedence. In the expression evaluation, operations should be performed according to their precedence (e.g., multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction). The current implementation evaluates the operations in the order they appear in the lists, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the case of the input ['**', '*', '+'] and [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is 37, but the function will not yield this due to the lack of proper precedence handling."
exp_1_HumanEval/161,HumanEval/161,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation does not handle the case where the input string contains no letters. According to the function description, if the string contains no letters, the function should reverse the string. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters present. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correctly handled, but if the input were to be something like '!!!', it would return '!!!' instead of '!!!' reversed, which is still '!!!'. The implementation fails to meet the requirement for strings without letters."
exp_1_HumanEval/162,HumanEval/162,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'string_to_md5' correctly implements the MD5 hashing for non-empty strings and returns None for empty strings. However, the test assertions include checks for specific MD5 hashes that are incorrect. For example, the hash for 'A B C' and 'password' do not match their actual MD5 hash values. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the test cases are flawed, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation."
exp_1_HumanEval/163,HumanEval/163,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b'. The expected behavior is to return even integers between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, but the implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without considering the order. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return [2, 4, 6, 8] but the current implementation will return an empty list because the range will not generate any numbers. Additionally, the test case 'generate_integers(132, 2)' is expected to return [2] but will also return an empty list due to the same issue."
exp_2_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'has_close_elements' incorrectly checks for close elements. The condition used in the loop only compares each number with the next one in the list, which may miss pairs that are not adjacent but still within the threshold. For example, in the test case 'has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3)', the numbers 2.0 and 2.2 are close enough but are not adjacent, leading to a failure in detecting them. A correct implementation would require a nested loop to compare each number with every other number in the list."
exp_2_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly separate the groups of parentheses. It appends the entire group to the list every time a closing parenthesis is encountered, but it does not handle the case where there are multiple groups in the input string. Additionally, it does not ignore spaces as specified in the function's description. The function should only append complete groups of balanced parentheses to the list, and it should skip spaces entirely."
exp_2_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'truncate_number' uses 'number.modf()' to decompose the number into its integer and decimal parts. However, 'modf()' is not a method of the float type in Python. Instead, it is a function from the math module. The correct usage would be 'math.modf(number)'. As a result, the current implementation will raise an AttributeError when executed, making it incorrect."
exp_2_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the operation to the balance. The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' when the operation is negative. This leads to incorrect balance calculations and thus incorrect results for certain test cases, such as those involving negative withdrawals."
exp_2_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'mean_absolute_deviation' contains a critical error: it uses 'Math.abs' instead of 'abs'. In Python, the correct function to calculate the absolute value is 'abs', not 'Math.abs'. This will lead to a NameError when the function is executed. Additionally, the test assertions are incorrect for the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] as the expected result should be 2/3, which is approximately 0.6667, not 0.6666. The calculations for the Mean Absolute Deviation are also not correctly reflected in the test cases, as they do not match the expected results based on the definition provided in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `intersperse` function does not correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. Specifically, the logic used in the for loop causes the delimiter to be added incorrectly. For example, when the input is [5, 6, 3, 2] with a delimiter of 8, the expected output is [5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 8, 2], but the current implementation will produce [5, 8, 6, 8, 3, 2] instead, missing the last delimiter after the last element. Additionally, the condition `if i % 2!= 0 or i!= len(numbers) - 1:` leads to incorrect behavior when the list has an odd number of elements. The implementation needs to be revised to ensure that the delimiter is added correctly between all pairs of elements."
exp_2_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct increment operation should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are unmatched parentheses, which could lead to negative counts. This could result in incorrect maximum nesting levels being recorded. The logic for counting the maximum depth is also flawed because it does not account for cases where the parentheses are not balanced, potentially leading to incorrect results."

However, the test assertions provided in the 'check' function are incorrect. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']' is incorrect because the expected output should include all occurrences of 'xxx', which means it should return ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] as stated, but the assertion fails because the expected output does not match the actual output. Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is also incorrect because 'run' is not a substring of 'grunt' or 'prune', hence the expected output should be an empty list []. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the test cases do not accurately reflect the expected behavior."

Specifically, when the list includes a zero, the product should be zero, but the current implementation will return a non-zero product since it initializes 'product' to 1 and multiplies it by each number in the list. For example, 'sum_product([100, 0])' should return (100, 0), but it will return (100, 0) correctly, but for other cases like 'sum_product([1, 2, 3, 0])', it will return (6, 0) instead of (6, 0). The test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)' passes, but the logic is flawed for other cases involving zero. Thus, the implementation does not correctly compute the product when zeros are present."

Instead, it should find the longest palindromic suffix and append the necessary prefix to create a palindrome. The test cases in the 'check' function are also incorrectly checking 'is_palindrome' instead of 'make_palindrome'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function string_xor does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. The XOR operation should be applied to all bits of both strings, and if one string is shorter, the missing bits should be considered as '0'. For example, for inputs '111000' and '101010', the expected output should be '010010', but the current implementation will only XOR the first three bits, resulting in an incorrect output. Additionally, the test case '0101' and '0000' is expected to return '0101', which is correct, but the function does not account for the length of the strings properly."
exp_2_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first one in case of ties. However, the implementation only updates the longest_string when it finds a string longer than the current maximum length, which means it will not return the first occurrence in case of ties. For example, in the test case `['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']`, 'yyy' and 'zzzz' both have lengths of 3 and 4 respectively, but if there were two strings of the same maximum length, the function would return the last one encountered instead of the first one."

The function iterates through the range of the string's length plus one, appending each prefix (from the start of the string to the current index) to the 'prefixes' list. The provided test assertions also validate the function's correctness, as they cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."

Additionally, the test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' should return 5 distinct characters, but the way the function is structured does not handle the concatenation correctly as it does not consider the case insensitivity properly. The function should also handle all characters, not just alphabetic ones."

For example, the input 'o| o| .| .| o o' should return [2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4] instead of [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]."

exp_2_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it incorrectly checks 'candidate(encoded_str)'. This leads to a failure in validating the correctness of the encoding and decoding process."
exp_2_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number that is prime within the first n Fibonacci numbers, rather than the n-th prime Fibonacci number. For example, when n=1, it correctly returns 2, but for n=2, it returns 3, which is correct, but for n=3, it returns 5, which is also correct. However, when n=6, it should return 233, which is correct, but the logic does not ensure that it is returning the n-th prime Fibonacci number. The function does not correctly iterate through the Fibonacci numbers to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number, and it does not account for Fibonacci numbers beyond the predefined list. Thus, the implementation is flawed and does not fulfill the function's purpose as described."
exp_2_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' does not correctly handle the requirement for distinct elements. The use of the 'seen' set is intended to track elements that have already been considered, but it prevents valid combinations of distinct elements from being checked. For example, in the case of the input [1, 3, -2, 1], the second '1' is ignored due to the 'seen' set, which leads to incorrect results. The function should instead check combinations of three distinct elements without prematurely excluding valid candidates."
exp_2_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains several issues. Firstly, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The function is supposed to count the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions, but the way it removes cars from the sets does not accurately reflect the collision scenario described. The expected number of collisions for n cars moving in opposite directions should be n * n, as each car from one direction collides with every car from the other direction. The use of 'collisions++' is also incorrect syntax in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Additionally, the loop structure and the conditions for removing cars are not correctly implemented. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results as indicated by the test assertions."
exp_2_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'incr_list' is correct, as it increments each element of the input list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test case is not validating the function correctly, leading to a failure in the overall correctness of the test suite."
exp_2_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,True,CORRECT,"The function pairs_sum_to_zero correctly implements the logic to check for two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. The nested loops iterate through all pairs of elements, and the function returns True if any such pair is found. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with positive, negative, and zero values, and the function passes all assertions, confirming its correctness."
exp_2_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'change_base' is incorrect. The function uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is not appropriate for converting a number 'x' from decimal to a specified base. Instead, it incorrectly interprets 'x' as a string in base 'base' and then formats it as a hexadecimal string (due to 'x' in the format function). The expected behavior is to convert 'x' from decimal to the specified base (less than 10), but the current implementation does not achieve this. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that expect the output to be in bases other than the specified range (less than 10), which further indicates that the implementation does not meet the requirements."
exp_2_HumanEval/45,HumanEval/45,True,CORRECT,"The function 'triangle_area' correctly implements the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base * height) / 2. The provided test assertions confirm that the function returns the expected results for the given inputs, including the example in the docstring. All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the implementation is correct."

The expected values for fib4(5), fib4(6), and fib4(7) are 4, 8, and 14 respectively, but the test assertions include fib4(8) = 28 and fib4(10) = 104, which are not derived from the correct sequence. The initial sequence values and the recursive formula used in the loop are not aligned with the expected outputs based on the provided definition. Therefore, the function does not produce the correct results for the given test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is correct for the first two test cases, but it fails for the second test case in the check function. The expected median of the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] is 10.0, but the function returns 15.0. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not correctly calculate the median for lists with an even number of elements."
exp_2_HumanEval/48,HumanEval/48,True,CORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse. The provided test cases in the 'check' function cover various scenarios, including empty strings, odd-length palindromes, even-length palindromes, and non-palindromic strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_2_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'modp' is incorrect for large values of 'n'. The expression '2 ** n' can result in very large numbers that exceed the limits of standard integer representation, leading to performance issues or incorrect results. Specifically, the test case 'modp(1101, 101)' should return 2, which is correct, but the function does not handle large exponents efficiently. Additionally, the test cases 'modp(30, 5)' and 'modp(31, 5)' are not covered in the function's docstring, and they are not guaranteed to return the expected results due to the potential overflow of '2 ** n'. A more efficient approach would be to use modular exponentiation to compute '2 ** n % p' without directly calculating '2 ** n'."
exp_2_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The encode_shift function is incorrectly implemented. The encoding logic shifts characters by 5 positions but does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet correctly. For example, if the input string contains uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters, the function will produce incorrect results. Additionally, the decode_shift function is not tested in the check function, which is supposed to verify the correctness of the decoding process. The assertions in the check function are meant to validate the decode_shift function, but they incorrectly reference encode_shift instead."
exp_2_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is intended to remove all vowels from the input string, but it incorrectly handles the case of characters that are not vowels. The implementation uses char.isalpha() to check if a character is an alphabet letter, which is unnecessary since the function is only supposed to remove vowels. Additionally, the function does not account for non-alphabetic characters, which should be retained in the output. For example, the test case 'abcdef' should return 'bcdf', which is correct, but the test case 'fedcba' should also return 'fdcb', which is incorrect because the implementation does not handle the case correctly. The test cases in the check function also include cases that are not covered by the original function's implementation, leading to potential failures."
exp_2_HumanEval/52,HumanEval/52,True,CORRECT,"The function 'below_threshold' correctly implements the logic to check if all numbers in the list are below the specified threshold.

Additionally, the random tests confirm that the function behaves as expected for a wide range of inputs."
exp_2_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, but it only checks if the characters are present in the same quantity. The provided test cases suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their counts. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True since both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', but the current implementation would return False due to differing counts. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_2_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion. The provided test assertions validate the function against known Fibonacci values, and all assertions pass without error. The function adheres to the expected behavior as described in the docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/56,HumanEval/56,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'open_brackets++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'open_brackets += 1'. This will cause the function to fail to execute properly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the function description."
exp_2_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the elements of a list are either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses '>=', which allows for repeated elements in a decreasing sequence, and '<=', which allows for repeated elements in an increasing sequence. This means that a list like [4, 1, 1, 0] is incorrectly evaluated as True, even though it is not strictly decreasing. The test cases also include assertions that would fail if the function were corrected to require strict monotonicity."
exp_2_HumanEval/58,HumanEval/58,True,CORRECT,"The function 'common' correctly identifies the unique common elements between two lists by converting them to sets, computes the intersection, and then sorts the result.

exp_2_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator 'i++', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed. The function modifies 'n' directly, and when it returns 'n', it may not be the largest prime factor as intended. The test cases in the 'check' function also include numbers that are not prime factors of the inputs, which indicates that the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'sum_to_n' is correctly defined to sum numbers from 1 to n using the 'sum' and 'range' functions. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function include an incorrect assertion: 'assert candidate(6) == 21' and 'assert candidate(11) == 66'. The correct sums for these inputs are 21 and 66, respectively, which are accurate. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test assertions are incorrect, leading to a failure in the check function."

exp_2_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'derivative' function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial starting from the first index (xs[1:]), which is incorrect. The derivative of a polynomial should be calculated by multiplying each coefficient by its respective power and then reducing the power by one. For example, for the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the correct derivative should be [1*1, 2*2, 3*4, 4*5] = [1, 4, 12, 20]. The current implementation does not perform this calculation and thus fails the provided test assertions."
exp_2_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function does not correctly compute the FibFib sequence as defined in the comments. Specifically, the base cases for fibfib(0), fibfib(1), and fibfib(2) are incorrectly handled. The function returns 'n' for inputs less than 3, which means fibfib(0) returns 0, fibfib(1) returns 1, and fibfib(2) returns 2 instead of the expected values. The correct base cases should be: fibfib(0) == 0, fibfib(1) == 0, and fibfib(2) == 1. This leads to incorrect results for the assertions in the check function, particularly for fibfib(2)."
exp_2_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where 'y' is a vowel only at the end of the word. The test cases provided do not cover all scenarios, such as words ending with 'y' or words with mixed cases. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'circular_shift' does not handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits correctly. According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, it should return the digits reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits. The test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is incorrect; the correct output should be '001' as per the test case, but the function will return '100' instead. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(97, 8) == ""79""' is also incorrect because shifting by 8 should reverse the digits, resulting in '79', which is correct, but the function does not handle the case of shifting by more than the number of digits correctly. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/66,HumanEval/66,True,CORRECT,"The function 'digitSum' correctly computes the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the input string. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and mixed-case strings, and the function passes all assertions without errors.

exp_2_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' has a logical flaw in handling the case where multiple even numbers are found with the same smallest value. The current code does not correctly update the smallest index when encountering an even number that matches the smallest even value. Specifically, the condition 'elif node % 2 == 0 and node == smallest_even' does not update the smallest_index correctly, leading to incorrect results in cases where the smallest even number appears multiple times. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) == [0, 1]', the expected output is correct, but the logic fails in other cases like 'assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4 ,8]) == [4, 1]', where it should return the first occurrence of 4 but may not do so due to the flawed index handling."
exp_2_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `search` does not correctly handle the requirement that the frequency of an integer must be greater than or equal to the integer itself. For example, in the test case `search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])`, the expected output is `1` because `1` appears once (which is equal to its value), but the function incorrectly returns `5` since it has a higher frequency than `1`. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where the maximum integer that meets the criteria is not the largest integer in the list. Therefore, the function fails to satisfy the problem requirements in multiple test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly implement the 'strange sorting' as described. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the same minimum or maximum values correctly. For example, in the test case 'candidate([0,2,2,2,5,5,-5,-5])', the expected output is '[-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2]', but the function will produce an incorrect output because it removes all instances of the minimum or maximum value instead of just one. This leads to incorrect results when there are duplicates in the list."
exp_2_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not correctly compute the area based on the triangle's side lengths. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its three sides (a, b, c) is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area values in the test cases do not match the correct area calculations based on the triangle's dimensions."
exp_2_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, an empty list should return False because it is not balanced (not a palindromic list). However, the current implementation returns True for an empty list. Additionally, the function checks for balance after checking the sum against the weight, which is not the intended order of operations. The checks for balance should occur before returning True, ensuring that both conditions (balance and weight) are satisfied."
exp_2_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `smallest_change` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The logic used in the second loop incorrectly assumes that the number of changes needed is simply the count of mismatches, but it does not account for the fact that each mismatch requires a change. The first loop correctly identifies if the array is already a palindrome, but the second loop does not correctly compute the number of changes needed. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6] should return 4, but the current implementation would return a wrong value due to the flawed logic."

According to the specification, if one list is empty and the other is not, the function should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in such cases. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) is incorrect as it should return ['hI', 'hi', 'hii'] based on the total character count, but it incorrectly returns ['hi', 'admin']. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function description."
exp_2_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. However, the implementation only checks if the number is prime itself and returns True if it is, which does not fulfill the requirement of checking for the multiplication of three primes. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle composite numbers or the specific case of being a product of three primes. For example, is_multiply_prime(8) should return False (as 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, not three distinct primes), but the current implementation would incorrectly return True. Furthermore, the assertion for 125 should also fail since it is not a product of three primes. Thus, the logic is flawed and does not meet the function's specification."
exp_2_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, it uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will cause a NameError in Python. Secondly, the condition to check if 'x' is a simple power of 'n' is flawed; it does not account for cases where 'n' raised to the power of the integer logarithm of 'x' may not equal 'x' due to rounding errors or when 'x' is not a perfect power of 'n'. For example, 'is_simple_power(9, 3)' should return True, but the current implementation would not handle this correctly. Additionally, the order of conditions should ensure that 'n' and 'x' are both greater than zero before performing logarithmic calculations to avoid potential math errors."
exp_2_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect. The expression 'a ** 2 ** 1 == a' does not check if 'a' is a cube of some integer. Instead, it simplifies to 'a ** 2 == a', which is only true for a few specific values (like 0 and 1). To correctly determine if 'a' is a cube, the function should check if the cube root of 'a' (using 'round(a ** (1/3))') cubed equals 'a'. This means that the function fails the provided test cases, particularly for values like 1000 and 1729, which are cubes of integers (10^3 and 12^3 respectively)."

Specifically, the function pads the binary representation with leading zeros to ensure it is always 8 bits long, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', but the function returns 'db00001111db', which is incorrect according to the expected output 'db1111db'. The function should return the binary string without padding, except for the 'db' prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Specifically, the function assigns 'A+' for a GPA of exactly 4.0, which is correct, but it incorrectly assigns 'B' for a GPA of 3.5 instead of 'A-', and it assigns 'D+' for a GPA of 1.2 instead of 'C'. The expected output for the test case candidate([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) is ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-'], but the actual output is incorrect due to the wrong assignments for the GPAs of 3.5 and 1.2. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `prime_length` function is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if a number is prime.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `string_length` is 2, which is a prime number. The test cases that expect `prime_length('orange')` to return False are correct, but the function fails to return the correct results for other test cases, such as `prime_length('kittens')`, which has a length of 7 (a prime number) but is incorrectly handled due to the flawed logic."

For example, for N = 150, the binary representation is '10010110', and the sum of its digits is 4 (1+0+0+1+0+1+1+0), which should return '100' (the binary representation of 4), but the function incorrectly returns '110' (the binary representation of 6). Similarly, for N = 147, the binary representation is '10010011', and the sum of its digits is 5, which should return '101' (the binary representation of 5), but the function incorrectly returns '1100' (the binary representation of 12). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the function's docstring."

Instead of using the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]), it uses the indices themselves (0 and len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior when determining whether to sort in ascending or descending order. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of indices is 0 + 6 = 6 (even), which would incorrectly lead to sorting in descending order, while the correct behavior should check the values 2 and 6 (sum = 8, even) and still sort in descending order, but the logic is flawed for other cases. The test cases that rely on the correct sum of the first and last values will fail."

The comments state that the letters should be shifted down by 'two multiplied to two places', which implies a shift of four positions. However, the code currently shifts the letters by only two positions. For example, 'h' should be shifted to 'l' (4 positions), but the code shifts it to 'j' (2 positions). This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly identify the second smallest element in all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the smallest and second smallest elements are the same. For example, in the test case next_smallest([1,1,1,1,0]), the expected output is None since there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the logic for updating second_smallest is flawed, as it does not properly check if the current element is distinct from the smallest before assigning it to second_smallest."
exp_2_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function has a syntax error where '++' is used instead of '+=' to increment the 'boredoms' variable.

The logic for checking if one number equals the sum of the other two is correct, but the function will not work as intended due to these errors."
exp_2_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly follow the specified requirements. Specifically, it fails to replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. Instead, it incorrectly appends the character from the original message at the index (i + 2) to the encoded string. For example, for the input 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Additionally, the expected output for the test cases does not match the actual output produced by the function."
exp_2_HumanEval/94,HumanEval/94,False,CORRECT,"The function 'skjkasdkd' correctly identifies the largest prime number from the input list and returns the sum of its digits. The implementation uses a helper function 'is_prime' (assumed to be defined elsewhere) to check for prime numbers. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, and all assertions pass without failure, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_2_HumanEval/95,HumanEval/95,False,INCORRECT,"The function check_dict_case has a logical flaw in how it determines if all keys are either in lower case or upper case. Specifically, the conditions for updating the flags 'all_lower' and 'all_upper' are not mutually exclusive. The code checks if a key is lower case and then sets 'all_upper' to False, but it does not correctly handle the case where a key is neither lower nor upper case. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the keys are mixed case, the function may incorrectly return True. Additionally, the test case with the keys 'fruit' and 'taste' should return False because 'taste' is not in upper case. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_2_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_up_to is expected to return an array of the first n prime numbers that are less than n. However, the implementation does not adhere to this requirement. For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5] (the primes less than 6), but the function instead returns [2, 3, 5] which is correct. However, count_up_to(7) should return [2, 3, 5] but it does not include 7 itself, which is not a prime number. The function's logic is correct for identifying primes, but the description of the function is misleading as it implies that the function should return the first n primes, rather than all primes less than n. The test cases also include assertions that are inconsistent with the function's description."
exp_2_HumanEval/97,HumanEval/97,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'multiply' is intended to return the product of the unit digits of the two integers provided. However, the expected results in the test assertions do not match the actual implementation. For example, 'multiply(19, 28)' should return 72 (unit digits are 9 and 8, and 9 * 8 = 72), which is correct, but 'multiply(148, 412)' should return 32 (unit digits are 8 and 2, and 8 * 2 = 16), which is incorrect. The assertion for 'multiply(14, -15)' should return 20 (unit digits are 4 and 5, and 4 * 5 = 20), which is correct. However, the assertion for 'multiply(76, 67)' should return 42 (unit digits are 6 and 7, and 6 * 7 = 42), which is also correct. The function fails to produce the expected results for the first test case, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."

The correct way to increment the count variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input string is empty correctly, as it would raise an IndexError when trying to access s[i] if the string is empty. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail the test assertions."
exp_2_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function closest_integer does not correctly handle the rounding away from zero for negative numbers. Specifically, when the fractional part is negative (as in the case of -15.5), the function incorrectly returns -15 instead of -16. Additionally, the logic for determining the closest integer is flawed because it does not account for the case where the fractional part is exactly 0.5, which should round away from zero. The function also does not handle the case where the input is a non-numeric string correctly, as it returns a string instead of raising an exception. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function description."

Additionally, the logic for determining the next odd or even number is not implemented correctly. Instead, the next odd number after an odd 'n' should be 'n + 2', and the next even number after an even 'n' should be 'n + 2' as well. The current implementation will not produce the expected results for the test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/101,HumanEval/101,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'words_string' is intended to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces. However, the current implementation only splits the string by ', '. This means it will not correctly handle cases where words are separated by spaces or multiple commas. For example, 'One,, two' would not be split correctly, and 'Hi my name is John' (with spaces) would also not be handled. The function needs to use a more flexible approach, such as using a regular expression or the 're.split' method to account for both commas and spaces."

The 'range' function is incorrectly using 'maxOf(x, y)' and 'minOf(x, y)', which are not defined. Instead, it should use 'max(x, y)' and 'min(x, y)'. Additionally, the range should include the end value, so the correct usage should be 'range(max(x, y), min(x, y) - 1, -1)'.

Specifically, it uses 'Integer.toBinaryString(Math.round(avg))', which is not valid Python syntax. In Python, the correct way to convert an integer to a binary string is to use 'bin()' function. Additionally, the rounding of the average should be done using 'round()' in Python, not 'Math.round()'. Therefore, the function will raise an error when executed, and it will not produce the expected results for the test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/104,HumanEval/104,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'unique_digits' is incorrect because it checks if all characters in the string representation of the number are odd digits, but it does not correctly convert each character back to an integer before performing the modulus operation. The condition 'all(d % 2 != 0 for d in str(num))' will raise a TypeError since 'd' is a string character, not an integer. The correct implementation should convert 'd' to an integer before checking if it is odd. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results for all test cases."

While it correctly sorts and reverses the array, it fails to convert the integers (1-9) into their string representations (e.g., 'One', 'Two', etc.). Instead, it appends the string representation of the numbers directly, which is not the intended behavior. Therefore, the assertions in the test cases will fail."
exp_2_HumanEval/106,HumanEval/106,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'f' is incorrect because it does not compute the sum of numbers from 1 to i correctly for odd indices. The sum should be calculated as sum(range(1, i + 1)), but the current implementation uses the factorial for even indices and the sum for odd indices, which is not aligned with the requirement. For example, for i = 3, the expected output is 6 (factorial of 3), but the implementation incorrectly returns 2 (the sum of numbers from 1 to 2). Additionally, the expected output for candidate(7) is incorrect as well, since the factorial of 7 is not computed correctly. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

The function should consider the sum of digits for negative numbers as well, where the first digit is negative. The test cases also suggest that the function should count numbers with a sum of digits greater than 0, but the implementation only counts non-negative numbers. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/109,HumanEval/109,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by right shifts. The current logic only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is insufficient. To solve the problem, the function should identify the point where the order breaks (i.e., where an element is greater than the next element) and ensure that the elements after this point can be shifted to the front without violating the sorted order. The provided test cases also include scenarios that the current implementation fails to handle correctly."
exp_2_HumanEval/110,HumanEval/110,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'exchange' does not correctly handle the logic for exchanging elements between the two lists. The current code attempts to replace odd elements in 'lst1' with corresponding elements from 'lst2' without checking if those elements from 'lst2' are even. This means that it could replace an odd number in 'lst1' with another odd number from 'lst2', which would not help in making 'lst1' consist entirely of even numbers. Additionally, the function does not consider the possibility of needing to exchange multiple elements to achieve the goal. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct results for some test cases, such as 'exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])' which should return 'NO' but could incorrectly return 'YES' depending on the elements exchanged."

The `Counter` is correctly counting the occurrences of each letter, but the expected output for the test cases is not being met. For example, the test case `histogram('a b c d g')` expects a dictionary with each letter having a count of 1, but the implementation will return a dictionary with only the letters that have the maximum count, which is incorrect. The function should return all letters with their counts, not just those with the maximum count."
exp_2_HumanEval/112,HumanEval/112,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'reverse_delete' is missing the implementation of the 'is_palindrome' function, which is necessary to check if the resulting string is a palindrome. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when it attempts to call 'is_palindrome(result)'. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(""mamma"", ""mia"") == ("""", True)' is incorrect because after removing 'm' and 'a', the result should be 'm' which is not a palindrome. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

The variable 'buckets' is decremented for each '1' found in the grid, but it does not reset after reaching zero, which means it will not allow for further extraction from subsequent rows. The function should keep track of the total number of times buckets are lowered, considering the capacity of the buckets and the total number of '1's in the grid. The current implementation will fail for cases where the total number of '1's exceeds the bucket capacity, leading to incorrect results."

Firstly, the syntax used for mapping and sorting is incorrect for Python; it appears to be a mix of Ruby syntax. In Python, the correct way to achieve the intended functionality would involve using list comprehensions or the built-in functions 'map' and 'sorted'. Secondly, the test assertions provided in the 'check' function do not match the expected output described in the function's docstring. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the assertion checks for [1, 2, 4, 3, 5], which is incorrect.

Additionally, the function does not correctly identify the closest vowel between two consonants as it only checks the character immediately after the second consonant. The test cases also reveal inconsistencies, such as 'full' returning 'u' instead of 'U', and 'Above' returning 'o' instead of 'A'. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

However, the implementation incorrectly counts the number of digits by converting the number to a string and using len(). This approach fails for negative numbers, as the '-' sign is counted as a digit, leading to incorrect results. For example, in the test case candidate([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3), the function would incorrectly sum -2, which has 2 digits, resulting in an incorrect total. The correct approach should check the absolute value of the number to determine the number of digits."

Specifically, the function first attempts to split the input string on whitespace, which is correct. However, if there are no words found (which is not the case for the provided examples), it then attempts to split on commas. This logic is flawed because the condition `if not words:` will never be true after the first split if there are any words present. Additionally, the handling of the case where there are no commas or whitespace is incorrect; it should return the count of lowercase letters in odd positions in the alphabet, but the implementation instead returns a list of their ASCII values.

The length should be calculated as 'end - start' instead of 'end - start + 1'. This is because the length of the intersection should not include both endpoints if they are equal, which is the case when the intervals touch but do not overlap. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the intersection length is exactly 1 correctly, as it should return 'NO' for lengths of 1, which is not a prime number.

For example, in the case of 'prod_signs([0, 1])', the expected output is 0, but the function will return 0 due to the multiplication by the product of signs (which is 0). Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1]) == -10' is incorrect based on the logic of the function, as the product of signs will be -1 (due to -1 in the array) and the sum of magnitudes is 9, leading to a result of -9, not -10.

Additionally, the expected outputs in the test assertions do not match the expected results based on the provided Tribonacci sequence definition. For example, 'tri(3)' should yield [1, 3, 2, 8], but the implementation does not produce this result due to the incorrect logic. Furthermore, the function should return integers instead of floats for the even cases, as the expected output in the assertions shows integers (e.g., 3.0 should be 3)."

However, the test case 'assert candidate([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10])==2' is also incorrect because the function should return the index of the first element that is less than its predecessor, which is at index 2 (value 2). The function fails to return the correct index in this case. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([4,8,5,7,3])==4' is incorrect because the function should return 2 (the index of 5) instead of 4.

However, the test case 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow' should return 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow' but it returns 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow', which is incorrect because it does not replace the two consecutive spaces with a dash.

The method 'isalpha()' will return True for strings that contain only letters, but it does not check if the string is empty.

This leads to incorrect results for test cases where the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3. For example, for the input [-56,-99,1,0,-2], the expected output is 3030, but the function will not produce this result due to the incorrect handling of the cubing condition."
exp_2_HumanEval/143,HumanEval/143,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify words with prime lengths. For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, so it should not be included in the output. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' is expected to return an empty string, which is correct. The issue arises with the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""', where 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime, but 'available' (9) is not. Therefore, the expected output should be 'there is no', not 'there is no place'. The implementation fails to account for the correct identification of prime lengths."
exp_2_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly determine if the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The current logic checks if the product of the evaluated float values is equal to its integer conversion, which can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in a whole number. This can be achieved by checking if (x_numerator * n_numerator) % (x_denominator * n_denominator) == 0. As a result, some test cases will fail, such as 'simplify(""1/6"", ""2/1"")' which should return False but may not due to the floating-point comparison."
exp_2_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'order_by_points' is incorrect because it sorts the list in descending order instead of ascending order based on the sum of the digits. The 'reverse=True' parameter in the 'sorted' function causes this issue. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly when calculating the sum of digits, as it treats the negative sign as a digit. The expected behavior is to sort by the sum of the absolute values of the digits, and if two numbers have the same sum, they should maintain their original order. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments and the provided test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' contains a syntax error where 'count++' should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for checking the first digit is incorrect; it only checks the second last digit instead of the first digit. The first digit should be obtained by dividing the number by 10 until it is less than 10. Therefore, the function will not return the correct results for the provided test cases."
exp_2_HumanEval/147,HumanEval/147,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a logical error in the condition that checks if the sum of the triples is a multiple of 3. The expression 'a[i] + a[j] + a[k] % 3 == 0' does not correctly evaluate the sum modulo 3 due to operator precedence. The modulo operation is applied only to 'a[k]', not to the entire sum. It should be '(a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0'. Additionally, there is a syntax error with 'count++', which should be 'count += 1' in Python. These issues will lead to incorrect results when the function is executed."
exp_2_HumanEval/148,HumanEval/148,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where planet1 is further from the Sun than planet2. In such cases, it should return the planets between them in the correct order, but the current implementation does not account for this. For example, when calling bf('Neptune', 'Venus'), it should return ('Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus'), but the implementation does not handle this scenario correctly. Additionally, the function does not return an empty tuple when the planets are the same, which is also a requirement."
exp_2_HumanEval/149,HumanEval/149,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sorted_list_sum' contains syntax errors and logical flaws. Firstly, the method 'filter' is not a valid method for lists in Python; it should use a list comprehension or the built-in 'filter' function. Secondly, the sorting logic is incorrect; it uses 'sortedBy' which is not a valid Python function. Instead, it should use 'sorted' with a key that sorts by length first and then alphabetically. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to filter out words based on their lengths. The test assertions also contain a mistake; the function is expected to return a list sorted by length and alphabetically, but the provided assertions do not consistently reflect this requirement."
exp_2_HumanEval/150,HumanEval/150,False,INCORRECT,"The function x_or_y is expected to return the value of x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. However, the implementation does not define the function is_prime, which is necessary for determining if n is prime. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion for n = 1, which is not a prime number, but the expected output is 0, which is correct according to the function's logic. However, the function's correctness cannot be fully evaluated without the is_prime function."
exp_2_HumanEval/151,HumanEval/151,False,INCORRECT,"The function double_the_difference does not correctly implement the logic described in the docstring. Specifically, it fails to ignore non-integer values and does not handle negative integers correctly. The function only adds the square of odd integers, but it also incorrectly adds 0 for even numbers instead of ignoring them. Additionally, the test cases provided in the check function reveal that the function does not return the expected results for certain inputs, such as candidate([5, 4]) which should return 25 but does not account for the odd number correctly. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_2_HumanEval/152,HumanEval/152,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'compare' is mostly correct, but it fails to handle cases where the guess is negative. The test case 'compare([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])' expects the output to be [2,4,6], which is correct based on the absolute differences. However, the test case 'compare([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])' expects the output to be [2,0,0,1], but the actual output would be [2,0,0,1], which is correct. The function does not have any issues with the logic, but the test cases are misleading in their descriptions. The function should return the absolute difference correctly, but the test cases should be reviewed for clarity. Overall, the implementation is correct, but the test cases may lead to confusion."
exp_2_HumanEval/153,HumanEval/153,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly handle the case where the strength of extensions is equal. The current logic compares the extensions using the '<' operator, which is not appropriate for determining which extension should be chosen when strengths are equal. Instead, the extensions should be compared based on their order in the original list. Additionally, the function does not define the helper functions 'count_uppercase' and 'count_lowercase', which would lead to a NameError when executed. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/155,HumanEval/155,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'even_odd_count' contains several issues. Firstly, the increment operators '++' are not valid in Python; they should be replaced with '+= 1'. Secondly, the division operation 'num /= 10' will convert 'num' to a float, which will cause the while loop to behave incorrectly when 'num' is an integer. Instead, integer division should be used with 'num //= 10'. Lastly, the return statement uses 'Pair', which is not defined in the code; it should return a tuple instead, using '(count_even, count_odd)'. These errors will lead to incorrect results and runtime exceptions."
exp_2_HumanEval/156,HumanEval/156,False,INCORRECT,"The function int_to_mini_roman does not correctly convert the integer 251 to its Roman numeral equivalent. The expected output for 251 is 'ccli', but the implementation returns 'ccli'. This discrepancy indicates that the mapping of numbers to Roman numerals is incorrect for certain values, leading to failed assertions in the check function."
exp_2_HumanEval/157,HumanEval/157,False,INCORRECT,"The function right_angle_triangle does not account for the fact that the longest side (hypotenuse) must be the last argument (c) in the Pythagorean theorem. The current implementation assumes that c is always the largest side, which is not guaranteed. For example, calling right_angle_triangle(6, 8, 10) would return False, even though it should return True because 6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2. The function needs to first identify the largest side and then apply the Pythagorean theorem correctly."
exp_2_HumanEval/158,HumanEval/158,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly identifies the word with the maximum number of unique characters and handles ties by returning the lexicographically first word. The implementation uses a set to count unique characters and updates the maximum word accordingly. All provided test cases pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_2_HumanEval/159,HumanEval/159,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'eat' does not correctly account for the scenario where there are not enough remaining carrots to satisfy the hunger. The calculation of 'eaten' is correct, but the calculation of 'left' is flawed. Specifically, 'left' should be calculated as 'remaining - (need - (eaten - number))' when there are not enough carrots to meet the 'need'. The current implementation will not return the correct results for cases where 'remaining' is less than 'need'. For example, for the input (2, 11, 5), the expected output is [7, 0], but the function will incorrectly calculate the number of carrots left. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_2_HumanEval/160,HumanEval/160,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'do_algebra' does not correctly handle the order of operations (operator precedence). For example, in the test case with operators ['**', '*', '+'] and operands [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is 37, but the function evaluates the expression from left to right without considering that exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication and addition. Therefore, the result is not computed correctly according to standard mathematical rules."
exp_2_HumanEval/161,HumanEval/161,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains no letters. According to the function description, if the string contains no letters, the function should return the reversed string. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters present. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correctly handled, but the function does not account for the requirement to reverse the entire string when there are no letters. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of mixed content correctly when letters are present, as it only changes the case of letters without reversing the string as a whole when necessary."
exp_2_HumanEval/162,HumanEval/162,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'string_to_md5' correctly computes the MD5 hash for the input string and handles the empty string case by returning None. However, the test assertions include expected MD5 hashes for 'A B C' and 'password' that are incorrect. The expected hash for 'A B C' should be 'c3fcd3d76192e4007c3f8f9e6e4c1b4f' and for 'password' should be '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'. Therefore, the test cases do not validate the function correctly, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation."
exp_2_HumanEval/163,HumanEval/163,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b'. The expected behavior is to return even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, but the current implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without considering the order. For example, when calling generate_integers(10, 2), it should return [2, 4, 6, 8] as per the description, but it will return an empty list because the range will not generate any numbers. Additionally, the test case 'generate_integers(132, 2)' is expected to return an empty list, but it will not be tested correctly since the range will not include any numbers. The implementation needs to sort the range or handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b' to ensure it meets the requirements."
exp_3_HumanEval/0,HumanEval/0,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'has_close_elements' is incorrect because it checks if the sum of any two numbers is less than the threshold instead of checking if the absolute difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold.

exp_3_HumanEval/1,HumanEval/1,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'separate_paren_groups' does not correctly separate the groups of parentheses. Specifically, it appends the 'group' to 'groups' every time a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, but it does not reset 'group' correctly when there are multiple groups in the input string. This leads to incorrect results, as seen in the provided test cases. For example, the input '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' should return ['()', '(())', '(()())'], but the current implementation would not handle the spaces correctly and would not separate the groups as intended."
exp_3_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'truncate_number' is intended to return the decimal part of a given positive floating point number. However, the implementation uses 'number.modf()', which is not a valid method for floating point numbers in Python. Instead, the correct approach would be to use 'math.modf()' or to manually compute the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number. Therefore, the function will raise an AttributeError when executed, making it incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the withdrawal to the balance instead of subtracting it. The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' when the operation is negative, which would correctly decrease the balance. This leads to incorrect results for cases where withdrawals exceed deposits, causing the function to return False when it should return True."
exp_3_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is correct in terms of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) as defined. However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the assertions do not match the correct MAD calculations. For example, the MAD for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), which is correctly asserted, but the expected value for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] is incorrectly stated as 1.0 instead of the correct value of 1.25. Similarly, the expected value for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is also incorrect. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the tests do not validate it properly."
exp_3_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. Specifically, the logic in the loop incorrectly adds the delimiter after every element, including the last one, which leads to an extra delimiter being added at the end of the result list. For example, calling intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4) should yield [1, 4, 2, 4, 3], but the current implementation would yield [1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4], which is incorrect. The test case check(candidate([2, 2, 2], 2) == [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] also fails because it would produce [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]."
exp_3_HumanEval/6,HumanEval/6,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'parse_nested_parens' does not correctly calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. Instead of tracking the maximum depth, it simply counts the number of open and close parentheses, which does not reflect the nesting levels. Additionally, the use of 'count++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'count += 1'. The function should maintain a variable to track the maximum depth encountered during the iteration over the characters in each group."

However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is incorrect because 'grunt' does not contain the substring 'run'. The correct output for this input should be an empty list, as none of the strings contain the substring 'run'. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the implementation is incorrect due to the faulty test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/8,HumanEval/8,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_product' does not handle the case of an empty list correctly. While it initializes 'sum_' to 0 and 'product' to 1, the loop that calculates the product does not execute for an empty list, leading 'product' to remain 1 as intended. However, the product calculation for non-empty lists is incorrect because it multiplies by 'number' without checking if 'number' is zero. For example, in the case of the input [100, 0], the expected product should be 0, but the function will return 0 due to the multiplication logic. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for cases where the input list contains a zero."
exp_3_HumanEval/9,HumanEval/9,True,CORRECT,"The function 'rolling_max' correctly computes the rolling maximum of the input list of integers. It initializes an empty list 'max_elements' and iterates through the input list 'numbers'. For each element, it appends the maximum of the current element and the last recorded maximum to 'max_elements'. The provided test cases in the 'check' function validate the implementation against various scenarios, including an empty list and lists with increasing, decreasing, and mixed values. All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_3_HumanEval/10,HumanEval/10,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'make_palindrome' is incorrectly implemented. The logic for finding the longest palindromic postfix is flawed. The variable 'longest_postfix' is initialized to the reverse of the entire string, which is incorrect. The loop should check for the longest palindromic prefix instead of the postfix. Additionally, the test assertions in the 'check' function are incorrectly checking 'is_palindrome' instead of 'make_palindrome'. The assertions should be directed towards 'make_palindrome' to validate its correctness."
exp_3_HumanEval/11,HumanEval/11,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle cases where the input strings are of different lengths. The XOR operation should be performed on all bits, and if one string is shorter, it should be padded with zeros on the left.

exp_3_HumanEval/12,HumanEval/12,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'longest' does not correctly handle the case where multiple strings have the same maximum length. According to the function's description, it should return the first string in case of ties. However, the current implementation will return the last longest string encountered in the loop, which violates this requirement. For example, if the input is ['abc', 'def', 'gh'], the function will return 'gh' instead of 'abc'. The test cases provided in the 'check' function also confirm this issue, as the assertion for candidate(['x', 'y', 'z']) expects 'x' but the implementation will return 'z'."

exp_3_HumanEval/15,HumanEval/15,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'string_sequence' does not include spaces between the numbers. The use of ''.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) results in a concatenated string without any delimiters. To fix this, the correct implementation should use ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1))) to ensure that the numbers are space-delimited as required by the function's description."
exp_3_HumanEval/16,HumanEval/16,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function count_distinct_characters is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the distinct character count should be case insensitive. The test case count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ') should return 3, which is correct, but the test case count_distinct_characters('abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE') should return 5, which is also correct. However, the implementation is unnecessarily checking if the character is not in the set before adding it, as adding to a set inherently ensures uniqueness. The function should simply convert the string to lowercase and return the length of the set created from the characters, which would simplify the code and maintain correctness."

The function treats each character individually, but the notes 'o|', 'o', and '.|' are multi-character strings that need to be recognized as single units. As a result, the function fails to return the correct list of beats for inputs that include these multi-character notes. For example, the input 'o| o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o' should yield [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4], but the current implementation will not produce this output."

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_3_HumanEval/19,HumanEval/19,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_numbers' is incorrect because the sorting key used in the lambda function, 'int(x[1:])', does not correctly convert the string representations of numbers ('zero' to 'nine') into their corresponding integer values. Instead, it attempts to convert the substring starting from the second character of each word, which leads to incorrect sorting. For example, 'three' would be treated as 'ree' which cannot be converted to an integer. The correct approach would involve mapping the string representations to their integer values using a predefined dictionary or list."

But in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output should be [1, 4, 5], which is incorrect because it retains the first occurrence of 2 and 3 instead of removing all duplicates.

For example, in the case of the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the function does not produce this output."

exp_3_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct, as it uses the built-in 'max' function to return the maximum element from the list. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], which should return 124, but the provided list in the original function's docstring returns 123. Therefore, the test case does not match the expected output, leading to an incorrect evaluation."
exp_3_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Instead, it should use 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' is correct, but the function will not run successfully due to this syntax error. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results as described in the docstring and the test assertions."
exp_3_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the values at the even indices. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted list of even indexed elements back to the current even index, rather than replacing all even indices with the sorted values. As a result, the function fails to produce the expected output for the provided test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is incorrectly testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', not 'encode_cyclic'. This leads to a failure in validating the correctness of the decoding process."
exp_3_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number found in the list of primes instead of collecting all Fibonacci primes. For example, when n = 1, it correctly returns 2, but when n = 2, it returns 3, which is correct, but the logic fails for higher values of n. The function does not iterate through all Fibonacci numbers and check for primality correctly. The test cases include Fibonacci primes beyond the pre-defined list, which the function does not account for, leading to incorrect results for n > 5. The function should generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality dynamically instead of relying on a fixed list."
exp_3_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' does not correctly check for distinct elements. The use of the 'seen' set is flawed because it adds elements as they are encountered, which means that it can skip valid combinations of 'a', 'b', and 'c' that could sum to zero. For example, if the list contains duplicate values, the function may incorrectly ignore them when they should be considered distinct. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs, such as [1, 3, -2, 1] where the distinct elements 1, -2, and 1 should be considered, but the implementation fails to do so."
exp_3_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains several logical errors and syntax issues. Firstly, the use of 'collisions++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Secondly, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The function does not correctly account for the fact that each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left. For n cars in each direction, the total number of collisions should simply be n * n, which means the expected output for the test cases should be n^2, not the values currently being returned. Therefore, the assertions in the check function will fail."

The expected output is correct, but the assertion does not match the expected output from the function. Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]' is also incorrect as the expected output should be [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124], but the assertion does not match the expected output from the function. Therefore, while the function is correct, the tests are not."

exp_3_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from decimal to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is incorrect for base conversion. The 'int(x, base)' function expects 'x' to be a string representing a number in the specified base, and the 'format' function with 'x' outputs a hexadecimal representation instead of the desired base. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that expect results for bases greater than 10, which contradicts the function's description. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements and fails to pass the tests."

However, the test assertions indicate that fib4(8) should return 28, fib4(10) should return 104, and fib4(12) should return 386. The function does not produce these results based on the provided recurrence relation. The expected values for fib4(5), fib4(6), and fib4(7) are also not validated against the recurrence relation, leading to a mismatch with the expected outputs. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is mostly correct, but there is an error in the expected output for the second test case in the check function. The median of the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] is actually 15.0, but the assertion in the check function incorrectly expects the result to be 8.0. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the implementation does not meet the expected behavior as defined in the comments."

All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected according to the provided docstring examples."
exp_3_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which is correct for calculating 2^n modulo p. The provided test cases, including the additional assertions in the check function, reveal that the function fails for certain inputs. Specifically, the assertions 'assert candidate(30, 5) == 4' and 'assert candidate(31, 5) == 3' are incorrect because 2^30 modulo 5 equals 4 and 2^31 modulo 5 equals 3, which are correct results. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases are misleading. The evaluation of the function is correct based on the mathematical definition, but the test cases should be re-evaluated for correctness."
exp_3_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode_shift' function is incorrect because it does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet ('a' to 'z'). The encoding logic assumes all characters are lowercase letters, which will lead to incorrect results or errors if the input string contains uppercase letters, digits, or special characters. Additionally, the 'decode_shift' function has a similar issue where it also assumes all characters are lowercase letters. The test assertions in the 'check' function will fail if the input string contains any characters that are not lowercase letters."
exp_3_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is intended to remove all vowels from the input string, but it incorrectly handles the case where the character is an alphabetic character that is a vowel. The implementation checks if the character is alphabetic and not in the set of vowels, but it does not account for non-alphabetic characters. Additionally, the test cases in the check function reveal that the implementation fails to produce the expected output for some cases, such as 'fedcba' which should return 'fdcb' but instead returns 'fdcb' (this is correct) and 'acBAA' which should return 'cB' but instead returns 'cB' (this is also correct). However, the function does not handle the case of mixed upper and lower case vowels correctly in some tests. Overall, the implementation does not consistently meet the requirements set forth in the function's description."

exp_3_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, but it currently checks if the sorted versions of the two strings are equal. This means it checks for the same characters in the same frequency, which is not the same as checking if they have the same unique characters. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' would return False, which is correct, but 'abcd' and 'dddddddabc' would also return True, which is incorrect because they do not have the same unique characters. The test cases provided in the docstring and the assertions in the 'check' function do not align with the actual implementation of the function."
exp_3_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function is correct for the provided test cases, but it is inefficient due to its exponential time complexity. The recursive approach leads to repeated calculations for the same Fibonacci numbers, which can cause performance issues for larger inputs. Additionally, the test cases in the 'check' function include assertions for fib(11) and fib(12), which are not covered in the original docstring. While the function returns the correct Fibonacci numbers for the tested cases, it does not handle larger inputs efficiently, making it impractical for real-world use."

exp_3_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This means that it will return True for lists that have equal consecutive elements, which is not aligned with the typical definition of monotonicity that requires strict inequality. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] returns True, but it should return False because it is not strictly decreasing. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

exp_3_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator 'i++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case when the remaining value of 'n' is a prime number greater than the last factor found. The function should return the largest prime factor found, but it currently returns 'n', which may not be a prime factor. The test cases in the 'check' function also include numbers that are not prime factors of the inputs, leading to incorrect assertions."
exp_3_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n is intended to sum numbers from 1 to n, and the implementation uses the formula n * (n + 1) / 2, which is mathematically correct.

exp_3_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial starting from the first index (xs[1:]), which does not correctly compute the derivative of the polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial term ax^n is n*ax^(n-1). Therefore, the correct implementation should multiply each coefficient by its respective power index. For example, for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the correct derivative should be calculated as follows: 1*1 (for x^1), 2*2 (for x^2), 3*4 (for x^3), and 4*5 (for x^4), resulting in [1, 4, 12, 20]. The current implementation fails to perform these multiplications, leading to incorrect results."

However, for n >= 3, the function should compute the sum of the three preceding values, which it does correctly. The test assertions include checks for fibfib(10) and fibfib(12) that are not validated by the current implementation, leading to potential discrepancies in expected results. The implementation fails to provide the correct output for all cases, particularly for n < 3."

The correct way to increment 'count' is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly, as it only checks for lowercase vowels. The test cases provided do not cover all scenarios, such as words with mixed case or words ending with 'y' that should be counted as a vowel. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."

According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the function should return the digits reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits if the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits. This leads to incorrect results for cases like circular_shift(100, 2), which should return '001' but instead returns '100'. Additionally, the test cases do not cover all edge cases, and the assertion for candidate(100, 2) fails, indicating the implementation is not correct."

exp_3_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'fruit_distribution' contains errors in how it extracts the number of apples and oranges from the input string. Specifically, the method used to split and strip the string does not correctly parse the quantities of apples and oranges. The line 'total_fruits = s.split("" "")[0].strip(""apples"")' will not yield the correct number of apples because it only retrieves the first word of the string, which is the number of apples, but does not account for the presence of 'and' or the second fruit type. Additionally, the line 'total_oranges = s.split("" "")[1].strip(""oranges"")' incorrectly assumes that the second word will always be the number of oranges, which is not the case. This leads to incorrect calculations and results in failing assertions in the test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even values are the same and the smallest. Specifically, the logic for updating 'smallest_index' when encountering an even number that is equal to 'smallest_even' is flawed. It should not update 'smallest_index' in this case, as it should retain the index of the first occurrence of the smallest even value. This leads to incorrect results for inputs like [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2], where the expected output is [0, 1], but the function may return an incorrect index due to the flawed logic."
exp_3_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'search' function does not correctly handle the requirement that the frequency of an integer must be greater than or equal to the integer itself. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because the integer 1 appears once, which is equal to its value. However, the function returns 5, which is incorrect as its frequency (4) is greater than its value (5). Additionally, the function does not account for the case where multiple integers meet the criteria; it only returns the greatest integer found, which may not be valid based on the frequency condition. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."

Specifically, when the minimum or maximum value is removed, if there are duplicates, only one instance is removed, which can lead to incorrect ordering in the final result. For example, in the case of the input [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not produce this output as it removes only one instance of -5 and 5 each time it is encountered. Thus, the function fails to achieve the desired 'strange order' sorting."
exp_3_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not represent the correct calculation for the area of a triangle given its three sides. The correct method to calculate the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is to use Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the rounding method used (area.round(2)) is incorrect; it should be round(area, 2). Therefore, the function will not return the expected results for valid triangles."
exp_3_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the list is empty. According to the problem description, an empty list should return False because it is not balanced (not a palindromic list).

exp_3_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The function currently returns the index of the last element that does not match its counterpart, which does not represent the number of changes required. For example, in the case of the input [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6], the function incorrectly returns 4 instead of the correct value of 4 changes needed. The logic should count the number of mismatches between the elements from the start and the end of the array, and return that count instead."
exp_3_HumanEval/74,HumanEval/74,True,INCORRECT,"The function total_match does not correctly handle the case where the total number of characters in both lists is equal. According to the specification, it should return the first list, but the implementation does not account for the case where the second list has the same total number of characters as the first list. The test case total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) is expected to return ['hi', 'admin'], but it will not pass because the total character count is equal (8 characters each).

For example, is_multiply_prime(30) should return True, but the function will return False for numbers like 8 and 10, which are not products of three primes. Additionally, the function does not account for the requirement of exactly three prime factors, as it only checks for primality. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the specified criteria."
exp_3_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will lead to a NameError in Python. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is not sufficient to ensure that x is a simple power of n; it should also check if 'x' is equal to 'n' raised to the power of 'int(math.log(x, n))' without the 'int' check. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion that expects 'candidate(9, 3) == True', which is incorrect since 9 is indeed 3 squared. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if x is a simple power of n."
exp_3_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it uses the expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' to determine if 'a' is a perfect cube. This method can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for larger integers. For example, while it may correctly identify small cubes like 1, -1, and 64, it may fail for larger numbers like 1000 or 1728 due to rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic. A more reliable approach would be to compute the cube root using integer arithmetic and check if cubing that integer returns the original number."

exp_3_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'decimal_to_binary' is incorrect because it does not correctly format the binary representation of the decimal number. Specifically, it pads the binary string with leading zeros to make it 8 bits long, which is not required by the problem statement. The expected output for decimal_to_binary(15) should be 'db1111db', but the current implementation would return 'db00001111db'.

exp_3_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct. The loop and condition used in the function do not properly evaluate all groups of 3 consecutive letters in the string. Instead, it incorrectly compares non-overlapping groups of 3 letters. For example, in the string 'iopaxioi', the function would incorrectly return True, while it should return False because the substring 'ioi' contains repeating letters. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements for determining if a string is happy."

However, the GPA of 1.0 should yield 'D+', but the implementation will return 'D+' for values greater than or equal to 1.0, which is also correct. The issue arises with the GPA of 0.0, which should yield 'E' but is handled correctly. The test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, particularly around the threshold values, leading to potential inaccuracies in grading. The implementation should be revised to ensure that it strictly adheres to the specified grading boundaries."

Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the string length is 2, which is a prime number. The loop that checks for factors starts from 2 and goes up to the string length, but it should check only up to the square root of the string length for efficiency and correctness. Additionally, the function should return True for strings of length 2, which it currently does not. Therefore, the assertions that expect True for strings of length 2 will fail."

The function does not filter for even numbers, leading to incorrect results for several test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not preserve the spaces between words in the output.

The sorting logic combines two separate sorts into one return statement, which results in incorrect ordering. Specifically, it first sorts by row in ascending order and then appends a separate sort by column in descending order, which does not maintain the intended structure of having all coordinates of the same row together. The correct approach would be to sort the coordinates first by row and then, for each row, sort the columns in descending order."
exp_3_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of summing the values at the first and last indices of the array, it sums the indices themselves (0 and len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior for arrays with more than one element. For example, for the array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last values (2 + 6) is 8 (even), but the function will incorrectly sort it in descending order because it checks the sum of indices (0 + 6 = 6, which is even). Thus, the sorting logic does not work as intended based on the problem description."

However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the new character position. The formula used in the code does not account for the correct rotation when characters are near the end of the alphabet. For example, 'y' should become 'c', but it incorrectly wraps around to 'a'. Additionally, the test cases provided do not match the expected outputs based on the described functionality. For instance, 'faewfawefaewg' should yield 'jeiajeaijeiak' according to the test case, but the actual output does not match this expectation. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_3_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly identify the second smallest element in all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the smallest element appears multiple times. For example, in the case of next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected output is None since there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the logic for updating the second_smallest variable is flawed, as it does not properly account for the scenario where the smallest value is repeated."

Firstly, the return values 'true' and 'false' should be 'True' and 'False' (with capital T and F) in Python. Secondly, the condition to check if all numbers are integers is incorrectly placed; it should be checked before performing any arithmetic operations. The current implementation will raise an AttributeError because 'float' objects do not have an 'is_integer()' method. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the inputs are not integers properly, as it does not return False if any of the inputs are not integers. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_3_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. The logic for replacing vowels is flawed, as it incorrectly calculates the index and does not properly handle the replacement within the same loop. Additionally, the function appends an extra character after each vowel, which is not intended. For example, in the test case 'This is a message', the expected output is 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG', but the implementation does not produce this result."
exp_3_HumanEval/94,HumanEval/94,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'skjkasdkd' contains an error in the way it calculates the sum of the digits of the largest prime number. Specifically, it uses the division operator '/' instead of the integer division operator '//' when reducing 'largest_prime' in the while loop. This will cause 'largest_prime' to become a float, which will lead to incorrect results when calculating the sum of its digits. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where there are no prime numbers in the list correctly, as it returns 0 instead of an appropriate value. The test cases provided may pass, but the implementation is fundamentally flawed."

However, the implementation does not correctly handle the requirement of returning the first n primes. Instead, it returns all prime numbers less than n, which does not align with the function's description. For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5] (the first 3 primes), but the implementation would return [2, 3, 5]. The test cases also include assertions that expect the function to return a specific number of primes, which the current implementation does not satisfy."

Specifically, when the input is '-15.5', the expected output is -16, but the function will not return this correctly due to the way it calculates candidates. The candidates list only includes integers that are directly adjacent to the value, which does not account for the correct rounding behavior specified in the function's description. The logic for determining the closest integer should explicitly check for equidistant cases and round accordingly."

The correct approach should be to start from 'n' and add the next odd/even number based on the parity of 'n'. Therefore, the expected output does not match the actual output for the provided test cases."

Specifically, the use of 'maxOf' and 'minOf' is incorrect as these functions are not defined in the provided code. Instead, the correct approach should use 'max' and 'min' functions. Additionally, the range function is incorrectly set up; it should iterate from 'max(x, y)' to 'min(x, y) - 1' (inclusive of 'max' and exclusive of 'min') to correctly check for even numbers in the specified range. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail the assertions."

Firstly, the method 'Integer.toBinaryString' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with 'bin()' to convert an integer to its binary representation. Secondly, the rounding of the average is incorrectly handled; the method 'avg.roundToInt()' does not exist in Python. Instead, the average should be rounded using the built-in 'round()' function. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include assertions that will fail due to the incorrect implementation of the rounding and binary conversion. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the comments."
exp_3_HumanEval/104,HumanEval/104,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'unique_digits' is incorrect because it attempts to check if all digits of a number are odd by iterating over the string representation of the number and applying the modulo operation. However, it incorrectly applies the modulo operation to the string characters instead of their integer values. The expression 'all(d % 2 != 0 for d in str(num))' will raise a TypeError since 'd' is a string character and cannot be used with the modulo operator directly. The correct approach would be to convert 'd' back to an integer before performing the modulo operation."
exp_3_HumanEval/105,HumanEval/105,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'by_length' does not correctly handle the requirement to ignore numbers outside the range of 1 to 9. Specifically, the function sorts the entire array, including negative and larger numbers, before filtering. This leads to incorrect results when the input contains numbers outside the specified range. For example, the input [1, -1, 55] should return ['One'], but the current implementation would return an empty list because it sorts and reverses the entire array before filtering. The filtering should occur before sorting and reversing to ensure only valid numbers are processed."
exp_3_HumanEval/106,HumanEval/106,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function f has a logical error in the calculation of the sum for odd indices. The sum should be the sum of numbers from 1 to i, but the current implementation uses 'sum(range(1, i + 1))', which is correct. However, the expected output for f(7) is incorrect; it should return [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28], but the factorial of 7 is 5040, not 720.

exp_3_HumanEval/109,HumanEval/109,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'move_one_ball' does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by right shifts. The current logic checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not the requirement. The function should instead check if there is a single point in the array where the order breaks (i.e., an element is greater than the next one), and ensure that the array can be considered circularly sorted. For example, the input [3, 5, 10, 1, 2] should return False, but the current implementation incorrectly returns True because it only checks for a sorted order without considering the circular nature of the shifts."

For example, in the test case exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3]), there are not enough even numbers in lst2 to replace all odd numbers in lst1, yet the function incorrectly returns 'YES'. The logic should ensure that after attempting to replace all odd numbers in lst1, if any odd numbers remain, it should return 'NO'."

For example, the test case assert(candidate('mamma', 'mia')) should return ('', True), but the implementation does not account for this correctly. Additionally, the function could be optimized by using a list to collect characters and then joining them, rather than concatenating strings in a loop, which is less efficient."

This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases."
exp_3_HumanEval/114,HumanEval/114,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function minSubArraySum is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array. The nested loops create sub-arrays and calculate their sums, but the logic fails to account for the fact that the minimum sub-array can consist of a single element. Additionally, the implementation is inefficient with a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the use of slicing and summing sub-arrays. A more efficient approach would be to use a single pass with a variable to keep track of the current minimum sum, which would reduce the time complexity to O(n)."

The variable 'buckets' is initialized to 'capacity' but is not reset after each iteration of the outer while loop. This means that once the buckets are used up in one pass through the grid, they are not replenished for subsequent passes, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the code uses 'grid.shape' which is not valid for a list of lists in Python; it should use 'len(grid)' for rows and 'len(grid[0])' for columns.

For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' should be '[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]' based on the number of ones in binary representation, but the provided implementation does not sort correctly according to the specified criteria.

Firstly, the loop iterates from the end of the word to the beginning, but the conditions to find consonants and vowels are not correctly checking for the closest vowel between two consonants. Specifically, the condition 'if word[i] in consonants and word[i + 1] in consonants' will not return the closest vowel; instead, it will return an empty string if two consonants are found. Additionally, the function converts the entire word to uppercase, which causes it to lose the case sensitivity required by the problem statement. The test cases also indicate that the function does not return the expected results for several inputs, such as 'full' and 'Above'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

The checks for individual strings being balanced are unnecessary, as the function should only check if the total number of opening and closing parentheses across both strings are equal. Additionally, the function fails to account for the order of concatenation, which is crucial for determining if a valid sequence can be formed. For example, the input ['(()(())', '())())'] should return 'No' because even though both strings have balanced parentheses individually, their concatenation does not yield a balanced string. The function should instead check if the total number of opening parentheses is greater than or equal to the total number of closing parentheses at every point in the concatenation process."

For example, for the input arr = [-3, -4, 5] and k = 3, the expected output is [-4, -3, 5], but the function will return [5, -3, -4], which is incorrect."

Additionally, the checks for the number of days for months with 31 days are redundant since they are already covered by the general check for days being between 1 and 31. The function also does not handle the case where the day is 0 or negative, which should return False.

For example, in the case of 'prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])', the expected output is -9, but the function calculates it incorrectly. The product of signs for this input should be -1 (since there is one negative number), and the sum of magnitudes is 9, leading to the correct result of -9.

Additionally, the recursive case for odd n is incorrectly implemented, as it uses tri(n + 1) instead of tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n - 1). The test assertions also expect floating-point numbers (e.g., 2.0, 3.0), which is inconsistent with the expected integer outputs of the Tribonacci sequence. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_3_HumanEval/131,HumanEval/131,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'digits' is incorrect because it initializes 'odd_digits' to 0 and uses multiplication to accumulate the product of odd digits.

Instead, 'odd_digits' should be initialized to 1 (the multiplicative identity) and should be multiplied by 'digit' only when 'digit' is odd.

For example, in the case of the input '[[]]', the function will return True as expected, but for other cases like '[][]' or '[]', it will incorrectly return True due to the way the 'nested' variable is manipulated.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where both inputs are strings with commas correctly, as it only attempts to convert them to floats if both are strings. The test cases also indicate that the function should return the larger value in its original type, but the implementation does not ensure this when converting to float.

The correct implementation should consider all combinations of four positive even numbers that sum to n, not just check against a fixed value.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the substring before the dot is empty, as it only checks for the presence of a dot and not the content before it. The logic for counting digits is also flawed, as it does not properly account for the case where there are more than three digits after the initial check. Overall, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."

The current implementation squares the integer at index 0 (which is a multiple of 3) but does not account for the requirement that integers at indices that are multiples of 4 (but not multiples of 3) should be cubed. For example, in the list [-56,-99,1,0,-2], the integer at index 4 (-2) should be cubed, but the current implementation does not do this. Therefore, the output for this test case is incorrect, leading to an overall incorrect implementation."

For example, the input 'here' should return an empty string, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly. Additionally, the function lacks the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for determining if the length of a word is prime. Without this, the code will raise an error when executed."

The current logic checks if the product of the decimal values of the fractions is equal to its integer representation, which can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in a whole number by checking if the numerator modulo the denominator equals zero. This would ensure that the result is a whole number without relying on floating-point arithmetic."

The current implementation only sorts by the sum of digits, which can lead to incorrect ordering when multiple numbers have the same digit sum. For example, in the test case 'order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])', the expected output is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11], but the implementation will not maintain the original order for numbers with the same digit sum. To fix this, the sorting key should also include the index of the number in the original list to ensure stable sorting."

The correct approach would involve converting the number to a string and checking the first and last characters. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail the assertions."

Additionally, the function does not account for the case where the two planets are the same, which should return an empty tuple. The test case 'candidate(""Neptune"", ""Venus"")' is expected to return ('Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus'), but the current implementation will not handle this correctly."

Firstly, the method 'filter' is not a valid method for lists in Python; it should be 'filter()' or a list comprehension. Secondly, the sorting logic is incorrect; the function attempts to sort the list twice, which will not yield the desired result. The first sort by length will be overridden by the second sort, which sorts alphabetically. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to sort by length and filter based on even lengths.

Specifically, in the test case 'compare([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])', the expected output is [2,4,6], which is correct, but the assertion in the check function is incorrect. The expected output should be the absolute difference between the actual scores and the guesses, which is correctly calculated in the implementation. However, the test case itself is flawed as it does not align with the problem statement's requirement of comparing scores and guesses. The assertion should be revised to reflect valid comparisons, and the function should be tested with valid inputs to ensure correctness."

Specifically, the test case 'assert candidate(251) == 'ccli'' is incorrect because the correct Roman numeral for 251 is 'ccli', not 'ccli'. Additionally, the function does not handle the conversion for numbers greater than 399 correctly, as it relies on a simple list indexing method which does not account for the proper combination of Roman numeral symbols. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."
exp_3_HumanEval/157,HumanEval/157,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'right_angle_triangle' only checks if 'a^2 + b^2 == c^2', which assumes that 'c' is the longest side (hypotenuse).

To correctly determine if the triangle is a right triangle, the function should first identify the longest side and then check if the sum of the squares of the other two sides equals the square of the longest side. This is why some test cases, such as 'right_angle_triangle(10, 6, 8)', return incorrect results."

The logic for returning the total and remaining carrots is flawed. Specifically, when the total number of needed carrots exceeds the remaining carrots, the function should return the total eaten carrots as 'number + remaining' and the remaining carrots as '0'. However, the current implementation incorrectly returns 'number + remaining' for the total eaten carrots but does not account for the need correctly. For example, in the case of eat(5, 6, 10), the expected output is [11, 4], but the function would return [11, 10] instead, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the total needed is less than or equal to the remaining correctly, as it should return the remaining carrots after eating the needed amount."

However, the implementation evaluates it as (2 ** 3) * 4 + 5 = 32 + 5 = 37, which is correct in this case, but it will fail for other combinations where operator precedence matters. Additionally, the use of floor division (//) may lead to unexpected results if not handled properly with integer inputs. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the algebraic expression evaluation as described."

According to the function's description, if the string contains no letters, the function should reverse the string. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters. For example, '1234' should return '4321', which is correctly handled, but if the input were an empty string '', it would return '' instead of the expected behavior of reversing it. Additionally, the test cases do not cover the scenario of an empty string or a string with no letters, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the function's behavior."

Additionally, the test cases do not correctly reflect the expected behavior of the function when 'a' is greater than 'b'. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return [2, 4, 6, 8] but the implementation will return an empty list instead."

This can lead to incorrect results, as it may miss cases where the second number is less than the first. The correct condition should be 'if abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i]) < threshold'. This flaw is evident in the provided test cases, where the function fails to return the expected results for certain inputs."

Therefore, the implementation does not correctly return the decimal part of the number as intended."
exp_4_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the operation to the balance instead of subtracting it. The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' for negative values. This leads to incorrect balance calculations and causes the function to return incorrect results for certain test cases."

However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD values. For example, the MAD for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] should be 2/3 (approximately 0.6667), but the assertion checks for a value of 2/3 which is correct. The assertion for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] is also correct as it checks for 1.0. However, the assertion for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] checks for 6.0/5.0 which is incorrect.

For example, calling `intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)` should yield `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`, but the current implementation would produce `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4]`, which is incorrect.

Specifically, when the list contains a zero (e.g., [100, 0]), the product should be 0, but the current implementation will return 0 due to the initialization of 'product' to 1 and multiplying it by 0. The correct behavior should account for the case where the list contains a zero, resulting in a product of 0. Therefore, the function fails the test case 'assert candidate([100, 0]) == (100, 0)'."

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the polynomial degree is greater than 2, nor does it account for the possibility of multiple roots or complex roots. Therefore, the implementation is not robust and does not correctly find the zero of the polynomial for all valid inputs."
exp_4_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead of sorting the values at those indices, it incorrectly assigns the second element of the sorted slice (which may not be the intended behavior). For example, in the case of the input [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the function does not produce this output as it does not sort the entire list correctly at the specified indices. The test assertions also indicate that the function fails to meet the expected behavior in multiple cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from the input list. It first converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the resulting set. The provided test assertion confirms that the function produces the expected output for the given input.
exp_4_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'max_element' is correct as it uses the built-in 'max' function to return the maximum element from the list. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], which should return 124, but the provided list in the comment for the function states that the maximum is 123. This discrepancy indicates that the test case is incorrect, leading to a failure in the test even though the function itself is implemented correctly."
exp_4_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' is correct, but due to the syntax error, the function will not execute properly. Therefore, the function will not return the expected results as described in the docstring and the test assertions."
exp_4_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the values at the even indices. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted list of even indexed elements back to the current even index, rather than replacing all even indices with the sorted values. As a result, the output does not match the expected behavior described in the function's docstring and the provided test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing 'encode_cyclic' instead of 'decode_cyclic'. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it incorrectly checks 'encode_cyclic' instead. This means the test will always fail, as it is not verifying the decoding functionality."
exp_4_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number that is prime within the first n Fibonacci numbers, rather than the n-th prime Fibonacci number. For example, when n=1, it correctly returns 2, but for n=2, it returns 3, which is correct, but for n=6, it should return 233, which is correct, but the logic is flawed as it does not iterate through all Fibonacci numbers to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number. The function should generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number, rather than relying on a predefined list of Fibonacci and prime numbers."
exp_4_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' contains a logic error in the way it handles the 'seen' set. The purpose of the 'seen' set is to track distinct elements, but the current implementation incorrectly adds elements to 'seen' during the nested loops, which prevents the function from correctly identifying distinct triplets. As a result, it may return True for cases where there are not three distinct elements that sum to zero. For example, in the case of the input [1, 3, -2, 1], the function may incorrectly consider the duplicate '1' as a distinct element. The function should instead check combinations of distinct elements without prematurely adding them to the 'seen' set. A correct approach would involve using a different method to ensure that only distinct triplets are considered."
exp_4_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains an infinite loop due to the 'while True' statement, which prevents the function from terminating and returning a result. Additionally, the logic used to calculate collisions is flawed. The number of collisions should be calculated based on the formula n^2, as each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the collision scenario and will not produce the expected results."
exp_4_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is correctly implemented to increment each element of the list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error.

The correct output for this input should be [4, 3, 2], which is consistent with the function's intended behavior. The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) == [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]' is also incorrect; the expected output should be [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124], but it does not match the function's output. Therefore, the overall evaluation is incorrect due to the faulty test assertions."
exp_4_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is incorrectly implemented. The recursive call 'pairs_sum_to_zero(l, num)' is not valid because the function is defined to take only one argument (the list 'l'). This will lead to a TypeError. Additionally, the logic for checking pairs that sum to zero is not correctly implemented. The function should check if the negative of the current number exists in the 'seen' set, rather than making a recursive call. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirement of the function as described in the comments."
exp_4_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'change_base' is incorrect because it uses 'int(x, base)' which assumes 'x' is a string representation of a number in the specified base, rather than an integer. Additionally, the 'format' function with 'x' as the format specifier will not convert the number to the desired base correctly. The function should convert the integer 'x' to the specified base and return its string representation. The test cases also include assertions that would fail due to this incorrect implementation."
exp_4_HumanEval/45,HumanEval/45,True,CORRECT,"The function 'triangle_area' correctly implements the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base * height) / 2.

exp_4_HumanEval/46,HumanEval/46,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fib4 function does not correctly compute the Fib4 sequence as described. The initial sequence is set to [0, 0, 2, 0], which is correct for the first four values. However, the expected values for fib4(5), fib4(6), fib4(7), and further are not consistent with the provided test assertions. For instance, fib4(5) should be 4, but the calculation based on the sequence logic results in a different value. Additionally, the test assertions for fib4(8), fib4(10), and fib4(12) are not validated against the correct sequence values, indicating that the implementation does not adhere to the defined logic of the Fib4 sequence."
exp_4_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is mostly correct, but there is an error in the expected output for the second test case in the check function. The median of the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] is actually 15.0, but the assertion in the check function incorrectly expects the output to be 8.0. Therefore, the test assertions do not match the expected results from the median function, leading to a failure in the test."

The provided test assertions cover various cases, including empty strings, odd-length palindromes, even-length palindromes, and non-palindromic strings. All assertions pass without errors, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_4_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which can lead to incorrect results for large values of n due to integer overflow or excessive computation time. Specifically, the test cases 'modp(30, 5)' and 'modp(31, 5)' are not accounted for in the function's logic, leading to incorrect assertions. The correct approach should utilize modular exponentiation to efficiently compute the result without overflow."
exp_4_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode_shift' function is incorrect. The encoding logic shifts characters by 5 positions in the alphabet, but it does not handle characters that are not lowercase letters (e.g., uppercase letters, digits, or punctuation). Additionally, the 'decode_shift' function has a similar issue and also incorrectly shifts characters. The test assertions in the 'check' function are designed to validate the decoding function, but they incorrectly reference 'encode_shift' instead of the decoding function. Therefore, the code does not fulfill the requirements of encoding and decoding as described."
exp_4_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels does not correctly handle uppercase vowels. The vowels string only contains lowercase vowels, so when it checks for vowels using char.lower() not in vowels, it fails to account for uppercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U). As a result, the function does not remove uppercase vowels from the input string, which leads to incorrect outputs for test cases like 'acBAA' and 'EcBOO'. The implementation should include both lowercase and uppercase vowels in the check."
exp_4_HumanEval/52,HumanEval/52,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly checks if all numbers in the list are below the specified threshold. The implementation iterates through each number in the list and returns False if any number is greater than or equal to the threshold.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, and all assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_4_HumanEval/53,HumanEval/53,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'add' function correctly adds two integers and matches the expected outputs in the provided docstring. The test cases in the 'check' function validate the correctness of the 'add' function by asserting known results and also testing random pairs of integers, which further confirms that the function behaves as expected for a wide range of inputs."
exp_4_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, but it only checks if they have the same characters in the same frequency. The test cases indicate that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True because they both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', but the current implementation returns False due to differing frequencies."
exp_4_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number using a recursive approach. The provided test assertions validate the function against known Fibonacci values, and all assertions pass without errors. The function adheres to the expected behavior as described in the docstring."
exp_4_HumanEval/56,HumanEval/56,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'open_brackets++', which is not valid Python syntax. In Python, the increment operator '++' does not exist; instead, it should be 'open_brackets += 1'. This will prevent the function from executing correctly, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the logic for checking the brackets is correct, but due to the syntax error, the function will not work as intended."
exp_4_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This means that a list with duplicate elements will be considered as monotonically increasing or decreasing, which is not aligned with the typical definition of monotonicity. For example, the list [4, 1, 1, 0] is incorrectly evaluated as True, while it should be False because it does not consistently increase or decrease without flat segments. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described."
exp_4_HumanEval/58,HumanEval/58,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly identifies the common elements between the two lists by converting them to sets and using the intersection operator.

exp_4_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'largest_prime_factor' contains a syntax error with the increment operation 'i++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case when 'n' is reduced to a prime number. The final return statement should return the last value of 'n' only if it is greater than 1, which may not always be the case. The test cases in the 'check' function also include numbers that are not guaranteed to be composite, which could lead to incorrect assertions."
exp_4_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n is intended to sum all integers from 1 to n. The implementation correctly uses the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 to compute the sum. However, the test assertions in the check function include an assertion for candidate(6) which expects a result of 21, but the correct sum from 1 to 6 is 21. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test assertions are incorrect. The assertion for candidate(6) is valid, but the expected result is correct. The function itself is correct, but the test cases should be reviewed for correctness."
exp_4_HumanEval/61,HumanEval/61,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains syntax errors that prevent it from running correctly. Specifically, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be 'open_brackets += 1'. Additionally, the 'else if' statement should be 'elif', and the block following it should use a colon ':' instead of '{'. These issues will lead to syntax errors when the function is executed, causing it to fail before any logic can be evaluated."
exp_4_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial excluding the constant term (the first coefficient), but it does not correctly compute the derivative of the polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial term ax^n is n*ax^(n-1). Therefore, the correct derivative for the input [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] should be [1*1, 2*2, 3*4, 4*5] which results in [1, 4, 12, 20]. The implementation fails to multiply the coefficients by their respective powers, leading to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function is incorrect because the base cases for fibfib(0) and fibfib(1) should return 0, but the current implementation returns the input value 'n' for any n less than 3. This leads to incorrect results for inputs like fibfib(0) and fibfib(1). Additionally, the test assertions include checks for fibfib(10), fibfib(12), and fibfib(14), which are not validated by the current implementation, as the results for these inputs are not defined in the comments or the provided examples."
exp_4_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error: 'count++' is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment the count variable is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle uppercase vowels correctly, as the string 'vowels' is defined in lowercase. To fix this, the function should either convert the input string to lowercase or include uppercase vowels in the 'vowels' string. Furthermore, the test cases do not cover all possible scenarios, such as words ending with 'y' or mixed case inputs. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect and requires fixes."
exp_4_HumanEval/65,HumanEval/65,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'circular_shift' function does not correctly handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits. According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the function should return the digits reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits if the shift is greater than or equal to the length of the digits, which is incorrect. For example, for the input (100, 2), the expected output is '001', but the function will return '010' instead. This discrepancy leads to the failure of the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""'."
exp_4_HumanEval/66,HumanEval/66,True,CORRECT,"The function 'digitSum' correctly computes the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the input string. The implementation iterates through each character in the string, checks if it is uppercase using 'isupper()', and if so, adds its ASCII value (obtained using 'ord()') to the cumulative sum. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and mixed-case strings, and the function returns the expected results for all assertions. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_4_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, the logic for updating 'smallest_index' is flawed. The current implementation only updates 'smallest_index' when a smaller even number is found, but it does not correctly handle the case where the same smallest even number appears again at a smaller index. As a result, it fails to return the correct index for the smallest even number when duplicates exist. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4 ,8]) == [4, 1]', the expected output is [4, 1] because the first occurrence of 4 is at index 1, but the implementation may not return this correctly due to the flawed logic."
exp_4_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle cases where the maximum integer that meets the criteria is not the highest integer in the list. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because 1 appears once, which is equal to its value, but the function incorrectly returns 5 since it has a higher value but does not meet the frequency requirement. Additionally, the function uses 'lst.count(num)' which is inefficient for larger lists, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2). A more efficient approach would be to use a dictionary to count frequencies first."
exp_4_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'strange_sort_list' function does not correctly handle the case where there are duplicate minimum or maximum values in the list. For example, when the input is [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not alternate correctly between the minimum and maximum values due to the way it removes elements from the list. The function modifies the original list, which can lead to incorrect results when duplicates are present. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the list has only one element correctly, as it will not return the single element in the expected alternating order. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_4_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not correspond to any valid method for calculating the area of a triangle based on its side lengths. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle given its three sides (a, b, c) is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for triangle_area(1, 1, 1) is incorrect; it should be approximately 0.43, but the correct area is sqrt(3)/4, which is approximately 0.433. Therefore, the function does not return the correct area for valid triangles and fails the test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly check if the list is balanced (palindromic). The condition 'if q == q[::-1]' is checked after the sum condition, which means that if the sum exceeds 'w', it will not check for balance. Additionally, the function should return False if the list is not balanced, regardless of the sum. The logic should ensure that both conditions (being a palindrome and the sum being less than or equal to 'w') are satisfied before returning True."
exp_4_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The logic in the second loop incorrectly assumes that the number of changes needed is simply the count of mismatches, but it does not account for the fact that each mismatch requires a change. The function should return the total number of mismatches instead of decrementing from 'min_changes'. This leads to incorrect results for certain test cases, such as 'smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])' which should return 4, but the current implementation does not correctly compute this."

According to the function description, if both lists have the same total number of characters, the function should return the first list. However, the test case 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' is incorrect because the total number of characters in both lists is the same (8 characters each), but the function would return the second list instead of the first. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."
exp_4_HumanEval/75,HumanEval/75,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_multiply_prime is intended to check if a number is the product of exactly three prime numbers. However, the implementation only checks if the number is prime itself, returning True for prime numbers and False for non-prime numbers. This does not fulfill the requirement of checking for the multiplication of three primes. For example, is_multiply_prime(30) correctly returns True, but is_multiply_prime(8) incorrectly returns True, as 8 is not the product of three distinct primes. Additionally, the assertion for 125 should return False, as it is not the product of three primes. The logic for checking the multiplication of three primes is missing entirely."
exp_4_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will result in a NameError. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is not sufficient to cover all cases where x is a simple power of n. For example, it will incorrectly return False for cases where x is 1 and n is any positive integer, as 1 is a power of any number (n^0 = 1). Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True' is incorrect because 9 is indeed a power of 3 (3^2 = 9), but the implementation would return False due to the flawed logic. Overall, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if x is a simple power of n."
exp_4_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it does not accurately determine if an integer is a perfect cube. The expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' checks if the cube root of 'a' is an integer by looking at the fractional part, but this approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the implementation may not handle this correctly. A more reliable method would be to calculate the integer cube root and then cube it to check if it equals 'a'."
exp_4_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'hex_key' contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the condition in the if statement checks for the characters 'A', 'B', 'E', and 'D', but it should only check for 'A', 'B', 'D' since 'E' is not a prime hexadecimal digit according to the problem statement. Therefore, the function will not return the correct count of prime hexadecimal digits as specified in the comments."
exp_4_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the conversion of decimal numbers to binary when the binary representation is less than 8 bits. The implementation pads the binary string with zeros to ensure it is always 8 bits long, which is not consistent with the requirement to return the binary representation as is, with 'db' characters added at the beginning and end. For example, decimal_to_binary(1) should return 'db1db', but it would incorrectly return 'db00000001db'. Additionally, the test case for decimal 103 is incorrect because the expected binary representation is not padded to 8 bits, which is inconsistent with the function's logic."
exp_4_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct. The loop and condition used in the function do not properly evaluate all sets of 3 consecutive characters in the string. Instead, it incorrectly compares non-overlapping segments of the string. For example, in the string 'iopaxioi', the segments 'iop', 'opa', and 'pax' are not checked correctly, leading to incorrect results.

For example, a GPA of 3.7 should yield 'A', but the current implementation yields 'A+' for 4.0 and 'A' for values greater than 3.7, which is correct. However, it fails to assign 'B+' for a GPA of 3.0 and 'C+' for a GPA of 2.0, as it uses '>' instead of '>=' for those thresholds. The test cases provided will not pass for GPAs that are exactly on the boundary values."

Additionally, it fails to handle the case where `string_length` is 2 correctly, as it will return False for lengths of 2, which is a prime number. The test cases reveal that the function incorrectly returns True for strings of lengths that are not prime (e.g., 'world' which has length 5, and should return True, but the function logic is flawed). Therefore, the implementation does not correctly identify prime lengths for all test cases."

Additionally, the logic for counting n-digit integers that start or end with 1 is inefficient as it checks all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1, which is not necessary. Instead, a mathematical approach should be used to calculate the count directly based on the number of digits. The test assertions also assume the function is correct, but due to the aforementioned issues, the function will not return the expected results."

For example, for N = 150, the sum of the binary digits is 6, which should be returned as '110' (the binary representation of 6), but the function currently returns '6' (the decimal representation). Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for the provided test cases."

The correct approach should sort the coordinates first by row in ascending order and then, for each row, sort the coordinates by column in descending order. Therefore, the output does not match the expected results in the provided test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of using the values at the first and last indices of the array, it uses the indices themselves (0 and len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior for arrays with more than one element. For example, for the array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last index values is 0 + 6 = 6 (even), which would incorrectly lead to sorting in descending order, while the expected behavior is to sort based on the values 2 and 6, which would also yield an even sum but should not affect the sorting order. The test cases that rely on the correct sum of the first and last values will fail."

The expected output for 'faewfawefaewg' should be 'jeiajeaijeiak' if shifted by four places, but the implementation does not achieve this. Therefore, the assertions in the check function will fail for multiple test cases."

For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the function returns 1, which is incorrect because the second smallest element does not exist (all elements are the same). The function should return None in this case. Additionally, the test case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) is expected to return -35, but the correct second smallest element is 12, which is not handled correctly by the current implementation."
exp_4_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the way sentences are split does not account for the fact that splitting by multiple delimiters will create empty strings in the list. This could lead to incorrect counting of boredoms. The function should use a regular expression to split the string by all three delimiters and then check if each trimmed sentence starts with 'I'. The test cases also indicate that the function does not handle cases correctly, such as counting multiple sentences starting with 'I' in the same string."
exp_4_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' has several issues. Firstly, it uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will cause a NameError.

Instead, the function should check if each number is an instance of 'int'. Additionally, the logic for checking if one number equals the sum of the other two is correct, but the implementation fails due to the aforementioned issues."

Instead of replacing the vowel with the correct letter, it incorrectly appends the character from the original message at the index (i + 2) modulo the length of the message. For example, in the test case 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the implementation does not do this correctly. Additionally, the output of the test cases does not match the expected results, indicating that the function does not fulfill the requirements as specified in the comments."

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the dictionary contains non-string keys correctly, as it should return False in such cases. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specified requirements."

However, the test case 'assert candidate(7) == [2,3,5]' is incorrect as it should return [2,3,5] but the function does not limit the count to the first n primes. The test case 'assert candidate(10) == [2,3,5,7]' is also incorrect as it should return the first 4 primes, which is [2,3,5,7]. The function needs to be modified to limit the number of primes returned to n."

Similarly, multiply(19, 28) should return 72 (9 * 8), but the test expects 72, which is correct. However, the test case for multiply(14, -15) expects 20, but the actual result is 5 (4 * 5). Thus, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described."

Therefore, the implementation will fail for certain inputs."
exp_4_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function closest_integer does not correctly handle the rounding away from zero for equidistant cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine the closest integer is flawed. The candidates list is created based on the values immediately surrounding the input, but it only includes integers that are exactly one less, equal to, or one more than the input. This means that for cases like '14.5' and '-14.5', the function will not correctly identify the need to round away from zero, as it does not consider the actual distance to both integers. Instead, it uses the max function with a key that calculates the absolute distance, which does not guarantee the correct behavior for equidistant cases. For example, for '14.5', the candidates would be [14, 15], and the function would return 14 instead of 15. Additionally, the test assertions indicate that the function is expected to return -16 for '-15.5', which it would not do correctly either. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

Additionally, the logic for generating the next odd or even number is not implemented correctly. Instead, the next odd number after an odd n should be n + 2, and the next even number after an even n should be n + 2. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_4_HumanEval/101,HumanEval/101,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'words_string' is intended to split a string of words separated by commas or spaces. However, the current implementation only splits the string by ', ', which means it will not correctly handle cases where words are separated by spaces or multiple commas. For example, the input 'One,, two, three, four, five, six,' will not produce the expected output because it does not account for varying whitespace or multiple commas. The correct approach would be to use a regular expression or a more comprehensive split method to handle all cases of separation."

Additionally, the implementation does not filter out numbers outside the range of 1 to 9 as specified in the function description. The mapping of integers to their corresponding names also needs to handle the case where the integer is not in the range of 1 to 9, which should be ignored instead of returning an empty string.

For example, in the test case 'exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3])', it incorrectly returns 'NO' when it should return 'YES' because there are even numbers available to replace the odd numbers in 'lst1'.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the minimum sub-array is not contiguous correctly. For example, the test case minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3, 2, -10]) should return -14, but the current implementation may not yield this result due to the way it calculates sub-array sums. The approach is inefficient with a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the repeated summation of sub-arrays, which can be improved using a more efficient algorithm like Kadane's algorithm."

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the day is 0 or negative, which should also return False. The checks for the number of days in months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are redundant since they are already covered by the check for days being between 1 and 31.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the string representation of a number is invalid (e.g., 'abc'). This could lead to a ValueError that is not caught properly. The test cases provided do not cover all edge cases, such as comparing a float with a string that cannot be converted to a float."
exp_4_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is intended to check if a number can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. However, the implementation incorrectly generates a list of even numbers and checks if the sum of the first four even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) equals n. The correct approach should consider that the smallest sum of 4 positive even numbers is 8 (2 + 2 + 2 + 2), and any even number greater than or equal to 8 can be expressed as such. The function fails for inputs like 10, 12, and 16, which should return True, but the logic does not account for combinations of even numbers beyond the first four. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly evaluate the condition as described."
exp_4_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' only computes the factorial of 'n' (n!) and does not compute the Brazilian factorial as defined in the comments. The Brazilian factorial requires the product of all factorials from n down to 1, which means the function should calculate n! * (n-1)! * ... * 1!. The current implementation fails to account for this and will produce incorrect results for the test cases provided."
exp_4_HumanEval/140,HumanEval/140,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'fix_spaces' does not correctly handle the replacement of spaces as described in the docstring. Specifically, it replaces all consecutive spaces with a single '-' if there are more than 2 consecutive spaces, but it does not replace single spaces with underscores correctly. For example, the input 'Mudasir Hanif ' should return 'Mudasir_Hanif_' but instead it returns 'Mudasir_Hanif_' which is correct. However, the input 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow' should return 'Yellow_Yellow_Dirty_Fellow' but it returns 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow', which is incorrect. The function also does not handle leading spaces correctly, as seen in the test case '   Exa 1 2 2 mple', which should return '-Exa_1_2_2_mple' but fails to do so due to the incorrect handling of leading spaces. Overall, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."
exp_4_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains several issues. Firstly, the line 'digits_count++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'digits_count += 1'. Secondly, the check for the substring before the dot is flawed. The condition 'if not name_parts[0].isalpha() or name_parts[0].isdigit()' incorrectly allows names that are entirely alphabetic but fails to ensure that the name starts with a letter. It should check if the first character is a letter and that the entire substring is not empty. Lastly, the function does not correctly enforce the limit of three digits in the filename, as it only counts the total number of digits without checking their distribution in the filename. These issues lead to incorrect results for some test cases."
exp_4_HumanEval/142,HumanEval/142,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' does not correctly apply the squaring and cubing rules based on the index conditions. Specifically, the function squares the value at an index that is a multiple of 3, but it also incorrectly cubes the value at an index that is a multiple of 4, regardless of whether it is also a multiple of 3. The correct logic should only cube the value if the index is a multiple of 4 and NOT a multiple of 3. This leads to incorrect results for test cases such as 'candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2])' which should return 3030 but does not due to the flawed logic."

For example, in the test case 'here', the expected output is an empty string because 'here' has a length of 4 (which is prime), but the implementation incorrectly returns 'here' instead of an empty string. Additionally, the test case 'here is' should return 'is' since 'is' has a length of 2 (which is prime), but the implementation does not account for this correctly. The function is missing the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for determining if the lengths of the words are prime."
exp_4_HumanEval/144,HumanEval/144,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'simplify' does not correctly determine if the product of the two fractions results in a whole number. The condition 'return x_value * n_value == int(x_value * n_value)' is flawed because it compares a float to an integer, which can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point arithmetic. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in an integer. The correct approach would involve checking if (x_numerator * n_numerator) % (x_denominator * n_denominator) == 0."
exp_4_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the list based on the sum of the digits and maintain the original order for items with the same digit sum. The sorting key only considers the sum of the digits, but it does not account for the original index of the elements when there are ties in the digit sums. This leads to incorrect ordering in cases where multiple numbers have the same digit sum. For example, in the test case with [1, 11, -1, -11, -12], both -1 and 1 have the same digit sum of 1, but -1 should come before 1 based on its original index."

The line 'result.append(planets[i])' correctly collects planets between the two indices, but the return statement is flawed. It attempts to create a tuple using 'sorted(set(range(len(planets)) - set(index1, index2)))', which is not valid and does not reflect the intended behavior of returning the planets between the two specified planets. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where planet1 and planet2 are in reverse order (e.g., 'Neptune' to 'Venus'), which should also return an empty tuple. The test cases also include an assertion that checks for an invalid planet name ('Makemake'), which is not handled correctly in the implementation. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring."

Firstly, the method 'filter' is incorrectly used; it should be 'filter()' in Python, and it should be applied to a list, not called as a method on the list itself. Secondly, the sorting logic is flawed; the function first sorts by length and then sorts alphabetically, which will not maintain the length-based sorting order. The correct approach would be to use a single sort with a tuple key that sorts by length first and then alphabetically. Additionally, the assumption that all words will have the same length is incorrect as per the function description. The test cases also include assertions that may not be valid based on the function's intended behavior."

Without the implementation of 'is_prime', the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the function does not handle the case when 'n' is less than 2 correctly, as 1 is not a prime number but would return 'x' if 'is_prime' is not defined properly. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and cannot be considered correct."

Specifically, it fails to handle the case of ignoring non-integer numbers and does not correctly sum the squares of odd integers. The condition 'if num % 2 == 1' only checks for positive odd integers, but it should also ensure that the number is a positive integer. Additionally, the line 'result += 0' is unnecessary and does not contribute to the result.

However, the test case 'compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])' should return [4,4,1,0,0,6], which is also correct. The function does not account for the possibility of negative guesses leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the implementation is not robust enough to handle all possible inputs as described in the function's comments."
exp_4_HumanEval/153,HumanEval/153,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the strongest extension has the same strength as another extension. The current implementation uses string comparison to determine which extension to choose when strengths are equal, which is incorrect. The requirement states that if two extensions have the same strength, the one that appears first in the list should be chosen, but the current implementation may select an extension that comes later in the list if it is lexicographically smaller. This leads to incorrect results in cases where the strongest extensions have the same strength."
exp_4_HumanEval/154,HumanEval/154,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'cycpattern_check' is supposed to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word or its reverse is in the first word, which does not account for all possible rotations. For example, the test case 'cycpattern_check(""efef"",""fee"")' should return True because 'fee' is a rotation of 'efef', but the current implementation will return False.

Firstly, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with '+= 1'. Secondly, the division operator '/' is used instead of integer division '//' to remove the last digit from 'num'. This could lead to incorrect results, especially for negative numbers. Lastly, the return statement uses 'Pair' which is not defined in the code; it should return a tuple instead, like '(count_even, count_odd)'. These errors will cause the function to fail during execution."

Additionally, the implementation does not handle the conversion for numbers like 43 and 532 correctly, as the expected outputs are not provided in the code. The test cases include assertions for these numbers, and since the implementation fails to return the correct Roman numeral for at least one of the test cases, the overall implementation is deemed incorrect."

The current implementation assumes that 'c' is always the hypotenuse, which is not guaranteed. For example, right_angle_triangle(5, 12, 13) would work correctly, but right_angle_triangle(12, 5, 13) would incorrectly return False. The function should first identify the longest side and then check the Pythagorean theorem accordingly."

The correct logic should account for the fact that if the total number of carrots eaten (current + needed) is less than or equal to the remaining, it should return the total eaten and the remaining. However, if the total exceeds the remaining, it should return the total eaten (current + remaining) and 0 for remaining carrots, indicating that the rabbit is still hungry. The implementation incorrectly returns the remaining carrots instead of 0 in the first return statement."

For example, in the test case with operators ['**', '*', '+'] and operands [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is 37, but the function evaluates the expression from left to right without considering that exponentiation has a higher precedence than multiplication and addition. The correct evaluation should first compute 2 ** 3, then multiply the result by 4, and finally add 5. The function also does not handle cases where division by zero could occur, which could lead to runtime errors."

According to the function description, if the string contains no letters, the string should be reversed. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters present. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correct, but the function fails to reverse the string when it contains only non-letter characters.

The expected hash for 'A B C' is incorrect, and the expected hash for 'password' is also incorrect. Therefore, the implementation is not validated correctly by the provided tests."
exp_4_HumanEval/163,HumanEval/163,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where 'a' is greater than 'b'. The range function generates numbers from 'a' to 'b' in ascending order, which means if 'a' is greater than 'b', it will not generate any numbers, resulting in an empty list. However, the expected output for 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should be [2, 4, 6, 8], which is not produced by the current implementation. Additionally, the test case 'generate_integers(132, 2)' is expected to return [2, 4, 6, 8], but it will also return an empty list due to the same issue.

The condition 'if numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold' does not account for the absolute difference between the two numbers. It should be 'if abs(numbers[j] - numbers[i]) < threshold' to ensure that the distance is correctly evaluated regardless of the order of the numbers. This flaw leads to incorrect results for certain test cases.

It appends the 'group' to 'groups' every time a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, but it does not reset 'group' properly when encountering spaces or when groups are nested. This leads to incorrect results when the input contains spaces or multiple groups. For example, the input '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' should return ['()', '(())', '(()())'], but the current implementation would not handle the spaces correctly and would not produce the expected output."
exp_5_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'truncate_number' is incorrect because the method 'modf()' is not used correctly. The 'modf()' function returns a tuple where the first element is the fractional part and the second element is the integer part. The code assigns 'integer_part' to the first element and 'decimals' to the second element, which is the opposite of what is intended. Therefore, the function returns the integer part instead of the decimal part, leading to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the withdrawal to the balance. The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' for negative values to properly decrease the balance. This leads to incorrect results for cases where withdrawals exceed deposits, causing the function to return False when it should return True."

For example, the expected result for mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) should be 0.666... (2/3), but the assertion checks for 2/3 which is not the correct MAD. Similarly, the expected results for the other test cases are also incorrect. Therefore, while the function itself is correct, the tests do not validate it properly."
exp_5_HumanEval/5,HumanEval/5,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'intersperse' function does not correctly insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements of the input list. The current logic appends the delimiter after every odd index and also at the end of the list if the last index is reached. This results in an incorrect output for cases where the list has an odd number of elements or when the last element should not be followed by a delimiter. For example, 'intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)' should return [2, 2, 2, 2] but the current implementation would return [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] instead."

The correct output should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA'] without duplicates. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is also incorrect because 'grunt' does not contain 'run'.

According to the function's description, if there are multiple strings with the same length, it should return the first one encountered. However, the current implementation only updates longest_string when it finds a string longer than the previous maximum, which means it will not return the first string of maximum length if it appears after a longer string. For example, in the test case longest(['x', 'yyy', 'zzzz', 'www', 'kkkk', 'abc']), the expected output is 'yyy' since it is the first string of maximum length (4), but the function will return 'zzzz' instead."

It should be 'count += 1' instead of 'count++'. Additionally, the logic for counting overlapping occurrences is flawed because the index is incremented by only 1 after finding a substring, which may skip potential overlapping occurrences. For example, in the string 'aaaa' with the substring 'aa', the function should find 'aa' at indices 0 and 1, but it would miss the second occurrence due to the way the index is incremented."

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest elements are equal, as seen in the test case 'find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0])', where it should return (5.0, 5.0) but does not.

The current implementation does not achieve this, as it would return [1, 4, 5] correctly, but fails to remove all occurrences of 2 and 3. Thus, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."

All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements."
exp_5_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings based on the given prefix. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function are incorrect. The expected output for the second assertion should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] but the actual output will be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] which is correct. The issue lies in the test case where the prefix 'xxx' is used, and the expected output does not match the actual output. Therefore, the test assertions do not validate the function correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is intended to return only positive numbers from the input list. However, the second test assertion in the check function fails. The expected output for the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] is [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1], but the function returns [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1] which is correct. The issue is that the function does not account for zero as a non-positive number, which should not be included in the output. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function correctly identifies prime numbers based on the provided definition. It handles edge cases such as numbers less than or equal to 1, and it efficiently checks for factors up to the square root of 'n'. The test assertions in the 'check' function cover a variety of cases, including both prime and non-prime numbers, and all assertions pass successfully, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function assumes that the polynomial is of the form ax^2 + bx + c, where it only calculates the zero for a quadratic polynomial using the formula -b/(2a). However, the function is supposed to handle polynomials of any degree with an even number of coefficients. The provided test cases and the description suggest that it should find a root for higher degree polynomials as well, but the current implementation does not account for that. Therefore, it does not correctly find the zero of the polynomial for all cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead, it sorts the entire list and then replaces every third index with the corresponding value from the sorted list, which is not the intended behavior. The correct approach should involve extracting the values at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then placing them back into their original positions in the list."
exp_5_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list. It uses 'set' to remove duplicates and 'sorted' to sort the elements, which aligns with the provided docstring and the test assertion. The test case provided in the 'check' function confirms that the output matches the expected result."
exp_5_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The function max_element is correctly implemented to return the maximum element from a list. However, the test case in the check function contains an assertion that expects the maximum value from the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10] to be 124, which is incorrect. The actual maximum value in that list is 124, but the previous test case with 123 is correct. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the implementation is not being validated correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fizz_buzz function contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' in the numbers divisible by 11 or 13 is incorrect. The function should count how many times the digit '7' appears in the string representation of those numbers, but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results as indicated in the test assertions."
exp_5_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the values at the even indices of the list. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted even indices back to the first even index, rather than assigning the sorted values to all even indices. This results in incorrect output for the provided test cases, as the even indices should contain all sorted values, not just the first one."
exp_5_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion inside the 'check' function is checking if 'candidate(encoded_str) == str', which implies it is expecting the decoding function to return the original string when given the encoded string. However, it is passing 'encode_cyclic' as the candidate, which does not decode the string but encodes it. Therefore, the test will always fail, indicating that the implementation of the decoding function is not being validated correctly."
exp_5_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_fib' is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the current implementation only checks the first n Fibonacci numbers and returns the first one that is prime. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly iterate through all Fibonacci numbers to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number. For example, when n=6, the function returns 233, which is correct, but for n=7, it should return 1597, which is also correct. However, the function does not handle cases beyond the pre-defined list of Fibonacci numbers, and it will fail for larger values of n. Additionally, the function does not correctly implement the logic to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number as it prematurely returns upon finding the first prime Fibonacci number instead of continuing to count until the n-th one is found."
exp_5_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' does not correctly identify distinct elements when checking for combinations of three numbers that sum to zero. The use of the 'seen' set is flawed because it prevents the function from considering valid combinations of numbers that could sum to zero if they are distinct. For example, if the list contains the numbers 1, -1, and 0, the function would not find this valid combination because it would add elements to 'seen' and skip valid combinations. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct results for certain inputs."
exp_5_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'car_race_collision' contains several logical errors and syntax issues. Firstly, the use of 'collisions++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Secondly, the logic used to determine collisions does not accurately reflect the problem description. The number of collisions should be calculated based on the number of cars moving in opposite directions, which would simply be n * n (since each car from the left can collide with each car from the right). The test assertions expect the output to be n^2, but the current implementation does not produce the correct results as it does not correctly count the collisions based on the described scenario."
exp_5_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is correctly implemented to increment each element of the input list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect; the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test cases do not match the expected behavior of the function, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation of the implementation."
exp_5_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it calls itself recursively with two arguments, but the function is defined to take only one argument. This will lead to a TypeError. Additionally, the logic for checking pairs that sum to zero is not correctly implemented. The function should check if the negative of the current number exists in the 'seen' set, rather than calling itself recursively."
exp_5_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from base 10 to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is incorrect for the intended functionality. The 'int(x, base)' function expects 'x' to be a string representation of a number in the specified base, but 'x' is provided as an integer. Additionally, the 'format' function with 'x' as the format specifier converts the number to hexadecimal, not to the specified base. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for the test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/45,HumanEval/45,True,CORRECT,"The function 'triangle_area' correctly implements the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base * height) / 2.

exp_5_HumanEval/46,HumanEval/46,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fib4 function does not correctly compute the values of the Fib4 sequence as described in the comments. Specifically, the expected values for fib4(8) and fib4(10) do not match the computed values based on the provided sequence logic. The sequence should be calculated based on the defined recurrence relation, but the initial values and the calculations in the loop do not align with the expected outputs. Therefore, the assertions in the check function will fail."
exp_5_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the expected output for the second test case in the check function. The median of the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] should be calculated as (6 + 10) / 2 = 8.0, but the expected output in the docstring is 15.0, which is incorrect. Therefore, the function fails to meet the expected results as per the test assertions."
exp_5_HumanEval/48,HumanEval/48,True,CORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse. The provided test cases in the 'check' function cover various scenarios, including empty strings, odd-length palindromes, even-length palindromes, and non-palindromic strings. All assertions in the 'check' function pass, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_5_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which is correct for calculating the modulo. The issue arises with the test cases provided in the check function. Specifically, the test cases 'assert candidate(30, 5) == 4' and 'assert candidate(31, 5) == 3' are incorrect. The expected results for these cases should be '0' and '1' respectively, as 2^30 modulo 5 equals 4 and 2^31 modulo 5 equals 3. Therefore, the implementation is correct, but the test cases are not aligned with the expected outputs."
exp_5_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The encode_shift function is designed to shift characters by 5 positions in the alphabet, but the decode_shift function is incorrectly implemented. The decoding logic should reverse the encoding by shifting characters back by 5 positions. The current implementation of decode_shift incorrectly adds the ASCII value of 'a' instead of subtracting it, leading to incorrect decoding. Additionally, the modulo operation is not correctly applied to handle characters that wrap around the alphabet. Therefore, the test assertions in the check function will fail."
exp_5_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels does not correctly handle uppercase vowels. The vowels string only contains lowercase vowels ('aeiou'), so when it checks for vowels using char.lower() not in vowels, it fails to account for uppercase vowels ('AEIOU'). This leads to incorrect results for inputs like 'acBAA' and 'EcBOO', where uppercase vowels should also be removed. The test cases in the check function that involve uppercase vowels will not pass, indicating that the implementation is flawed."
exp_5_HumanEval/52,HumanEval/52,True,CORRECT,"The function 'below_threshold' correctly implements the logic to check if all numbers in the list are below the given threshold. It iterates through each number in the list and returns False if any number is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it completes the loop without finding such a number, it returns True. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, and all assertions pass, confirming the function's correctness."
exp_5_HumanEval/53,HumanEval/53,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'add' function correctly adds two integers and matches the expected outputs as described in the docstring and the test assertions.

The test cases suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True because they both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', but the current implementation returns False due to differing frequencies."
exp_5_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion. The base cases for n = 1 and n = 2 return 1, which is correct. The recursive case correctly sums the results of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers.

exp_5_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses '>=' and '<=' comparisons. For a list to be monotonically increasing, each element should be strictly less than the next (i.e., l[i] < l[i + 1]), and for it to be monotonically decreasing, each element should be strictly greater than the next (i.e., l[i] > l[i + 1]). The test cases also include a case with repeated elements (e.g., [4, 1, 1, 0]), which should not be considered monotonically decreasing according to the strict definition. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the intended logic."

exp_5_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator 'i++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because the final value of 'n' returned may not be the largest prime factor if 'n' is not reduced to 1. The function should also ensure that the final value of 'n' is checked to see if it is greater than the last factor found. The test cases in the 'check' function also include numbers that are not guaranteed to be composite, which may lead to incorrect assertions."
exp_5_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n correctly implements the logic to sum numbers from 1 to n using the range and sum functions. However, the test assertions in the check function include a test for candidate(6) which expects a result of 21. The correct sum from 1 to 6 is actually 21, so this assertion is correct. However, the assertion for candidate(11) which expects 66 is incorrect; the correct sum from 1 to 11 is 66. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the correctness of the implementation is incorrect due to the presence of an incorrect assertion."
exp_5_HumanEval/61,HumanEval/61,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'correct_bracketing' contains a syntax error. The increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with 'open_brackets += 1'.

Therefore, the function will not pass the assertions in the 'check' function."
exp_5_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial starting from the first index (xs[1:]), which is incorrect. The derivative of a polynomial represented by coefficients should be calculated by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and reducing the power by one. For example, for the polynomial 3 + 1*x + 2*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 5*x^4, the derivative should be [1, 4, 12, 20], which is correctly shown in the test case. However, the current implementation does not perform this calculation and simply returns the coefficients from the first index onward, which does not yield the correct derivative coefficients."

Specifically, the values for fibfib(5), fibfib(10), fibfib(12), and fibfib(14) should be calculated based on the recursive definition provided, but the current implementation does not yield the correct results for these inputs. For example, fibfib(5) should return 4, but the function does not compute this correctly based on the defined sequence."

Additionally, the logic for counting 'y' as a vowel only at the end of the word is not correctly implemented. The condition 'char.lower()!= 'y' or char.isalpha() and char.lower()!= 'y'' is incorrect and does not properly check if 'y' is at the end of the word. Furthermore, the test cases do not cover all possible scenarios, such as words with no vowels or words that end with 'y'. More test cases are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage."
exp_5_HumanEval/66,HumanEval/66,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'digitSum' does not correctly sum the ASCII codes of only the uppercase characters. Instead, it converts the entire string to uppercase and sums the ASCII values of all characters, regardless of whether they were originally uppercase or lowercase. For example, in the case of 'abAB', the function would compute the ASCII values of 'A' and 'B' as 65 and 66 respectively, but it would also compute the ASCII values of 'a' and 'b' as 97 and 98, leading to an incorrect total. The correct approach would be to check if each character is uppercase before adding its ASCII value to the sum."
exp_5_HumanEval/67,HumanEval/67,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function fruit_distribution is incorrect because it does not correctly parse the number of apples and oranges from the input string. The line 'total_fruits = s.split(""and"")[1].strip()' attempts to extract the total number of fruits, but it actually retrieves the part of the string after 'and', which is not the correct format. The function should instead extract the numbers of apples and oranges separately, sum them, and then subtract that sum from the total number of fruits 'n'. This leads to incorrect results for the test cases, particularly for cases where the number of apples and oranges is not at the end of the string or when the string format changes."
exp_5_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, the logic to update 'smallest_index' when encountering an even number equal to 'smallest_even' is flawed. The condition 'if i < smallest_index' is unnecessary and incorrect because 'smallest_index' is initialized to -1, which will never be less than any valid index. This means that if the first occurrence of the smallest even number is not the first in the array, it will not be correctly identified. Therefore, the function fails to return the correct index in some scenarios."
exp_5_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'search' does not correctly handle the requirement that the frequency of an integer must be greater than or equal to the integer itself. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1, but the function will return 5, which has a frequency of 4, not satisfying the condition (4 < 5). Additionally, the function does not account for the possibility of multiple integers meeting the criteria, and it only returns the maximum integer found, which may not be valid. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The provided implementation of the function `strange_sort_list` does not correctly handle the case where the input list has more than two elements. The logic of alternating between the minimum and maximum values is flawed because it does not account for the fact that after removing the minimum and maximum values, the next minimum and maximum may not be the next in the sorted order. For example, the input [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] should return [5, 9, 6, 8, 7], but the current implementation would not produce this result. Additionally, the function modifies the input list in place, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the original list is needed later. The test cases provided in the `check` function include cases that would fail with the current implementation."

The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not correspond to any valid formula for the area of a triangle given its side lengths. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle using its side lengths is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected results in the test cases do not match the expected area calculations based on valid triangle dimensions."

The function should first check if the list is a palindrome and then check the weight condition."
exp_5_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The current logic only returns the index of the last mismatch instead of counting the number of mismatches. To determine the number of changes required, the function should increment a counter each time a mismatch is found between the elements at positions 'i' and 'length - 1 - i'. The function should return this counter instead of the index."

According to the function's description, if one list is empty and the other is not, it should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in such cases, which is incorrect. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is also incorrect because the total characters in the first list (8) is less than the second list (9), so it should return ['hI', 'hi', 'hii'] instead."

Firstly, the return values 'true' and 'false' should be 'True' and 'False' (with capital T and F) in Python. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is not sufficient to handle all cases correctly. For example, it would return False for 'is_simple_power(1, 4)', which should return True since 1 is a power of any number (n^0 = 1). Additionally, the check 'x == n ** int(math.log(x, n))' does not account for cases where x is not a perfect power of n, leading to incorrect results in some assertions. The test cases also include assertions that would fail based on the current implementation, such as 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True', which is incorrect as 9 is indeed a power of 3 (3^2). Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's requirements."

This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for larger integers. For example, the cube root of 1729 is approximately 12.002, and when raised to the power of 3, it does not yield an exact integer. Therefore, the function may return incorrect results for certain inputs. A more reliable method would be to compute the integer cube root and check if cubing that integer returns the original number."

Specifically, it pads the binary representation to 8 bits by adding leading zeros, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', but the function returns 'db00001111db' instead of 'db1111db'. The padding is unnecessary and leads to incorrect outputs for numbers that do not require it. Additionally, the test case for 'decimal_to_binary(103)' is expected to return 'db1100111db', but the function will return 'db11001111db' due to the padding logic. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

exp_5_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the total sum of the digits of the binary representation of the integer N, but the test assertions are checking for the binary representation of that sum instead. For example, for N = 150, the sum of the binary digits is 6 (which is '110' in binary), but the function is expected to return '110' as the output, which is incorrect. The correct output for N = 150 should be '110' (the binary representation of the sum of digits), but the function is returning the sum itself as a string. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described."
exp_5_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the current implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 88])', the expected output is 88 because 88 is even and at index 1, but the function would return 0 if there were no even numbers at odd indices. The implementation does not fulfill the requirement specified in the docstring."
exp_5_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not maintain the order of words and blank spaces correctly. The implementation concatenates the ordered words without spaces, which results in a loss of the original spacing in the input string.

exp_5_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'get_row' does not correctly sort the coordinates as required. The current sorting logic combines two separate sorted lists: one sorted by row in ascending order and another sorted by column in descending order. This results in an incorrect final output. Instead, the coordinates should be sorted first by row in ascending order and then, for each row, by column in descending order. The correct approach would involve sorting the entire list of coordinates based on both criteria simultaneously."
exp_5_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the values rather than the indices. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the indices is 0 + 6 = 6 (even), which would incorrectly trigger a descending sort, while the correct behavior should be based on the values 2 (first) and 6 (last), which sum to 8 (even) and should also trigger a descending sort, but the logic is flawed. The test cases that rely on the sum of values will fail due to this mistake."
exp_5_HumanEval/89,HumanEval/89,True,INCORRECT,"The function encrypt is intended to rotate the alphabet by 4 positions (2 multiplied by 2). However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the new character position. The formula used in the code does not correctly account for the rotation, leading to incorrect outputs for the test cases. For example, the input 'hi' should yield 'lm', but the implementation does not produce the expected results for several test cases, such as 'faewfawefaewg' and 'hellomyfriend'. The assertions in the check function will fail due to these discrepancies."
exp_5_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,True,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is the same as the smallest element. For example, in the test case next_smallest([1,1,1,1,0]), the expected output is 1, but the function will return None because it checks if lst[1] is not equal to lst[0] after sorting. Additionally, the test case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) will return -35, which is incorrect as the second smallest element should be 12. The function fails to account for duplicates correctly and does not return the correct second smallest value in all scenarios."
exp_5_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' contains several issues. Firstly, the function only splits the input string by periods ('.') and does not account for sentences delimited by question marks ('?') or exclamation marks ('!'). This means that sentences ending with '?' or '!' will not be processed correctly. Secondly, the use of '++' for incrementing 'boredoms' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'boredoms += 1'. Lastly, the logic for checking if a sentence starts with 'I' is flawed because it checks each word in a sentence instead of checking the first word directly. Therefore, the function does not correctly count the number of boredoms as described."
exp_5_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' contains several issues. Firstly, the keywords 'true' and 'false' should be capitalized as 'True' and 'False' in Python. Secondly, the function does not check if all inputs are integers before performing the sum comparison. The condition 'y.is_integer()' and similar checks should be applied to all three parameters. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the inputs are not integers correctly, which leads to incorrect results for some assertions. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."

Instead, it appends the character from the original message at the index (i + 2) to the encoded string whenever it encounters a vowel. This results in incorrect outputs, as seen in the test cases. For example, for the input 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Additionally, the case swapping logic is not applied correctly in conjunction with the vowel replacement, leading to further discrepancies in the expected output."
exp_5_HumanEval/94,HumanEval/94,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the largest prime number in the list. The function assumes that '0' is not a prime number, which is correct, but it does not handle cases where there are no prime numbers in the list properly. The return value should be '0' if no prime is found, but the sum of digits of the largest prime is not calculated correctly in some cases. For example, the largest prime in the list [8191] is correctly identified, but the sum of its digits is incorrectly calculated as 19 instead of 17 (8 + 1 + 9 + 1 = 19). Additionally, the function does not handle negative integers or non-integer values, which could lead to unexpected behavior."
exp_5_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_up_to is supposed to return an array of the first n prime numbers that are less than n. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where n is less than or equal to 1, as it returns an empty list in those cases. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of primes returned to 'the first n primes' but instead returns all primes less than n. For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5] (which is correct), but count_up_to(7) should also return [2, 3, 5] (which is correct), but it does not adhere to the requirement of returning the first n primes. The test cases also include assertions that expect the function to return a certain number of primes, which the current implementation does not guarantee."

However, the expected results in the test cases do not match the actual results produced by the function. For example, 'multiply(148, 412)' should return 32 (8 * 4), but the test expects 16. Similarly, 'multiply(19, 28)' should return 72 (9 * 8), but the test expects 72, which is correct. However, 'multiply(14, -15)' should return 20 (4 * 5), which is also correct. The function fails to produce the correct output for the first test case, indicating that the implementation is incorrect."
exp_5_HumanEval/98,HumanEval/98,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment the count variable is 'count += 1'.

Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the comments."
exp_5_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function closest_integer does not correctly handle the case where the fractional part is exactly 0.5 or -0.5. Specifically, it fails to round away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers. For example, closest_integer('14.5') correctly returns 15, but closest_integer('-15.5') should return -16, which it does. However, the logic for determining the closest integer is flawed. The condition 'if fractional_part > 0.0' does not account for the case where the fractional part is exactly 0.5, leading to incorrect results for such inputs. The function should explicitly check for the case where the fractional part is 0.5 or -0.5 and round accordingly."

The functions 'even_number()' and 'odd_number()' are not defined in the provided code, leading to a NameError. The correct implementation should calculate the next odd or even number based on the last added stone count, not call undefined functions. For example, if the first level has 3 stones, the next level should have 5 stones (next odd), and if the first level has 4 stones, the next level should have 6 stones (next even). The current implementation will fail during execution due to these issues."

Additionally, the range in the for loop is incorrectly defined; it should iterate from 'max(x, y)' to 'min(x, y) - 1' (inclusive of both bounds) to correctly check for the largest even number in the specified range. The current implementation will not return the expected results for all test cases."
exp_5_HumanEval/103,HumanEval/103,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rounded_avg' contains several issues. Firstly, the method used to convert the average to binary is incorrect; it uses 'Integer.toBinaryString' which is not valid in Python. Instead, Python provides the 'bin()' function for converting integers to binary. Additionally, the rounding method 'avg.roundToInt()' is also incorrect; in Python, rounding can be done using the built-in 'round()' function. Therefore, the function will raise errors when executed and will not produce the expected results."

The condition 'all(d % 2 != 0 for d in str(num))' will raise a TypeError since 'd' is a string and cannot be used with the modulus operator. The correct approach should convert each character back to an integer before performing the modulus operation. Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include a case that is not covered by the implementation, which is the case of numbers with even digits. The function should be revised to correctly check for even digits and return the appropriate results."

Specifically, the function sorts the entire array, including negative numbers and numbers greater than 9, before filtering. This leads to incorrect results for inputs like [1, -1, 55], where the expected output is ['One'], but the function would return an empty list instead. The sorting and reversing steps are unnecessary for the final output, which should only consist of the names of the valid numbers in the specified range."

The correct sum for an odd index i should be sum(range(1, i + 1)), which is correct, but the factorial calculation for even indices is not defined in the code. Additionally, the factorial function is not imported or defined in the provided code, which will lead to a NameError. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."

Firstly, the use of 'count++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'count += 1'. Secondly, the logic for calculating the sum of digits for negative numbers is flawed. The conversion of the number to a string and splitting it by '-' does not correctly handle the signed digits. Additionally, the condition for positive numbers incorrectly checks 'sum(str(num)) > 0', which will always return True since the sum of characters in a string representation of a number is not a valid operation. The test cases also reveal that the function does not correctly count the numbers based on the sum of their digits, leading to incorrect results."

The current logic only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order without considering the effect of right shifts. For example, the input [3, 5, 10, 1, 2] should return True because it can be sorted by shifting the elements. The function needs to check if there is at most one point in the array where the order breaks (i.e., where arr[i] > arr[i + 1]), which indicates a potential rotation point. If there is more than one such point, it is impossible to sort the array with right shifts."

The function should instead check if there are enough even elements in lst2 to replace all odd elements in lst1. For example, the case exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 4]) should return 'YES' because lst2 has even numbers that can replace the odd numbers in lst1, but the current implementation would return 'NO'."

This means that the function does not correctly account for the fact that multiple units of water can be extracted with a single bucket lowering. Instead, it stops counting once the bucket is empty, which does not reflect the total number of times buckets need to be lowered. The correct approach should involve counting how many total units of water there are in the grid and then dividing that by the bucket capacity to determine the total number of bucket lowerings needed.

Firstly, it incorrectly checks for consonants and vowels by using the indices 'i' and 'i + 1', which leads to incorrect behavior when checking pairs of characters. Specifically, it does not correctly identify the closest vowel that stands between two consonants. For example, in the case of 'FULL', the function should return 'U', but it incorrectly checks the characters in a way that leads to returning an empty string. Additionally, the function converts the entire word to uppercase, which causes it to lose the case sensitivity required by the problem statement. The test cases also include assertions that are not correctly handled by the function, such as 'full' returning 'u' instead of 'U'.

Additionally, the path is constructed by appending values from the grid without considering the order of traversal, leading to incorrect results for the provided test cases. For example, the expected output for the input grid [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] with k = 3 is [1, 2, 1], but the implementation will not guarantee this output due to the lack of proper path management and ordering."

Additionally, the test case candidate([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10]) returns 2, which is also incorrect because the element at index 2 (2) is less than the preceding element (4), but it should return the largest index that meets the condition, which is 1 (the index of 4). Therefore, the implementation does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the function's description."

Additionally, the function does not account for the case where both inputs are strings with commas, which could lead to incorrect comparisons. The test cases also indicate that the function should return the larger value in its original type, but the current implementation converts everything to float, losing the original type information."

However, the implementation incorrectly generates a fixed list of even numbers [2, 4, 6, 8] and checks if the input number equals the sum of these numbers. The sum of [2, 4, 6, 8] is 20, which means the function will only return True for n = 20, and False for all other inputs. The test cases provided in the check function include numbers like 10, 12, and 16, which can indeed be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers (e.g., 10 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4, 12 = 2 + 2 + 4 + 4, 16 = 2 + 2 + 6 + 6), but the current implementation will not return True for these cases.

Instead, it should check if the first character is a letter and ensure that the substring before the dot is not empty. Additionally, the logic for counting digits is not correctly implemented, as it does not account for the case where there are more than three digits after the initial checks.

Secondly, the sorting logic is flawed; it first sorts by length and then sorts alphabetically, which will not maintain the intended order. The correct approach should involve a single sort with a tuple key that sorts by length first and then alphabetically. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to filter out odd-length strings.

The function does return the correct output for this case, but the assertion in the test case is misleading as it does not match the expected output format. The test case 'compare([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])' is also incorrect; it should return [2,0,0,1] but the expected output is not clearly defined in the test case.

Additionally, the test case 'cycpattern_check(""efef"",""eeff"")' should return False, but the implementation does not correctly handle this case either. The test assertions in the 'check' function also indicate that the implementation fails for multiple cases."

For example, in the case of eat(2, 11, 5), the total is 7, which is less than 11, so the rabbit would eat all 5 remaining carrots, resulting in [7, 0], which is correct. However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the total as the sum of eaten and remaining without considering how many carrots the rabbit actually eats.

However, the current implementation evaluates operations strictly from left to right without considering precedence, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the expression '2 + 3 * 4' would be evaluated as '(2 + 3) * 4' resulting in 20 instead of the correct 14. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(['**', '*', '+'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 37' is incorrect as it does not follow the correct order of operations either. The correct evaluation should be '2 ** 3 * 4 + 5' which equals 37, but the implementation does not guarantee this result due to the lack of precedence handling."

All assertions pass without errors, confirming that the implementation behaves as expected."
exp_6_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'largest_divisor' does not correctly handle the case when n is a prime number. According to the provided docstring, the function should return the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n. However, for prime numbers like 3 and 7, the function incorrectly returns n itself (3 and 7 respectively) when it should return 1. The test cases in the 'check' function expect the output to be 1 for prime numbers, which is the correct behavior, but the current implementation fails to meet this requirement."
exp_6_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'factorize' contains a syntax error where 'i++' should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be 'n //= i' to ensure that 'n' remains an integer throughout the factorization process. As a result, the function will not work correctly for inputs that require multiple iterations of factorization, leading to incorrect outputs."
exp_6_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once from the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each number. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4], which is correct. But in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output should be [1, 4, 5] because both 2 and 3 occur more than once and should be removed entirely. The implementation does not satisfy this requirement, leading to incorrect results."
exp_6_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each character in the input string. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character, applying 'upper()' to lowercase characters and 'lower()' to uppercase characters.

All assertions pass without errors, indicating that the function meets the specified requirements."
exp_6_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The function 'concatenate' correctly implements the behavior described in the docstring. It concatenates a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method, which is the appropriate way to concatenate strings in Python.

exp_6_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings that start with the given prefix. However, the test case in the 'check' function is incorrect. The expected output for the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] with the prefix 'xxx' should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], but the implementation returns ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] which is correct. The issue lies in the assertion that does not match the expected output correctly. Therefore, while the function works as intended, the test cases provided do not validate it correctly."

However, the first test assertion is incorrect as it expects the output to be [4, 5, 6] for the input [-1, -2, 4, 5, 6], which is correct. Therefore, the function does not pass all assertions, leading to an overall evaluation of INCORRECT."
exp_6_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_prime' is missing an import statement for the 'math' module, which is necessary for using 'math.sqrt(n)'. Without this import, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the test cases in the 'check' function include assertions for numbers that are not prime, but the implementation does not handle the case of 0 and negative numbers correctly, as they should also return False. Therefore, the function is not fully correct."
exp_6_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'find_zero' is incorrectly implemented. The logic used to find the zero of the polynomial is based on the assumption that the polynomial is quadratic (degree 2), which is not valid for all polynomials with an even number of coefficients. The formula used, -xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1]), is derived from the quadratic formula, which only applies to second-degree polynomials. For higher-degree polynomials, this approach will not yield correct results. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly find the zero of the polynomial for all valid inputs as described in the comments."
exp_6_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_third' does not correctly handle the requirement to sort only the values at indices that are divisible by three. Instead, it sorts the entire list and then replaces every third index with the corresponding value from the sorted list. This leads to incorrect results for the test cases provided, as the values at indices divisible by three should be sorted among themselves, not replaced by sorted values from the entire list."

The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum value in the list is actually 124, not 123 as stated in the first test case. Therefore, the test assertions do not accurately reflect the expected output for the provided input."

Instead, it should use 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers divisible by 11 or 13 is correct, but the function will not execute properly due to the syntax error. Therefore, the function will not pass the test assertions."
exp_6_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the values at the even indices. The current implementation only replaces each even index with the first element of the sorted list of even indexed values, rather than replacing them with the sorted values in the correct order. For example, in the test case sort_even([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]), the even indexed values are [5, -5, -3, 9, 123, -10], which when sorted gives [-5, -3, 5, 9, 123, -10]. However, the function only places the first sorted value (-5) at each even index, leading to incorrect results."
exp_6_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should be checking if 'decode_cyclic(encoded_str)' returns the original string 'str', but it incorrectly checks 'candidate(encoded_str) == str' where 'candidate' is set to 'encode_cyclic'. This leads to a logical error in the test, as it is not verifying the decoding process."
exp_6_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation incorrectly returns the first Fibonacci number found in the primes list instead of counting how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found. As a result, it fails to return the correct n-th prime Fibonacci number for inputs greater than 5. For example, prime_fib(6) should return 233, but the current implementation will not reach that point correctly due to the early return statement. The test assertions for n=6 and beyond will fail."

Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_6_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'car_race_collision' contains several issues. Firstly, the use of 'collisions++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'collisions += 1'. Secondly, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the number of collisions based on the description provided. The expected number of collisions for n cars moving in opposite directions should be n * n, as each car from one direction collides with each car from the other direction. The test assertions expect outputs of 4, 9, 16, 64, and 100 for inputs 2, 3, 4, 8, and 10 respectively, which correspond to n^2. However, the current implementation does not produce these results, indicating that the logic is incorrect."

The expected output should be [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124], but the assertion incorrectly states it should be [6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]. Therefore, the overall correctness of the implementation is compromised by the incorrect test assertions."

All assertions in the check function pass, confirming the implementation is correct."
exp_6_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from base 10 to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is incorrect for this purpose. The 'int(x, base)' function expects 'x' to be a string representing a number in the specified base, but 'x' is passed as an integer. Additionally, the format specifier 'x' converts the number to hexadecimal, not the desired base. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results as demonstrated in the test assertions."
exp_6_HumanEval/45,HumanEval/45,True,CORRECT,"The function 'triangle_area' correctly calculates the area of a triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2.

exp_6_HumanEval/46,HumanEval/46,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fib4 function is incorrect because it does not produce the expected results for all test cases. The initial sequence is defined as [0, 0, 2, 0], which is correct for the first four values. However, the expected outputs for fib4(8) and fib4(10) do not match the computed values based on the provided logic. The function should return 28 for fib4(8) and 104 for fib4(10), but the actual outputs are not verified against the expected results. The test cases indicate that the function does not correctly compute the values of the fib4 sequence beyond the initial values."
exp_6_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is mostly correct, but it fails to return the correct median for the second test case in the check function. The expected median for the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] is 8.0, but the function returns 15.0. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not handle the calculation of the median correctly for even-length lists, as it does not account for the correct values in the sorted list."
exp_6_HumanEval/48,HumanEval/48,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_palindrome' correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse.

All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_6_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which can lead to incorrect results for large values of n due to integer overflow or excessive computation time. The test cases provided include assertions that check the correctness of the function, but the function fails to handle cases where n is large efficiently. For example, while the function passes the provided test cases, it does not account for potential performance issues with large n. A more efficient approach would be to use modular exponentiation to compute the result without directly calculating 2^n, which could be very large."
exp_6_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode_shift' function is incorrect because it does not properly handle the wrapping of characters when shifting. The calculation for the new character's ASCII value does not account for characters that are beyond 'z'. Additionally, the 'decode_shift' function has a similar issue in its implementation. The modulo operation should be applied after adjusting for the base character ('a'), and the logic for decoding is incorrect. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail, as the encoded string cannot be correctly decoded back to the original string."
exp_6_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is intended to remove vowels from the input string, but it incorrectly handles the case of characters that are not vowels. Specifically, it checks if a character is alphabetic and then checks if its lowercase version is not in the set of vowels. This means that non-alphabetic characters (like digits or punctuation) are not included in the result, which is not the expected behavior according to the test cases. For example, the test case remove_vowels('zbcd') should return 'zbcd', but the implementation does not account for non-vowel alphabetic characters correctly. Additionally, the test case remove_vowels('fedcba') is not covered in the original function's docstring, which could lead to confusion about its expected behavior."

exp_6_HumanEval/54,HumanEval/54,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'same_chars' is intended to check if two words have the same characters, meaning they should contain the same unique characters regardless of their frequency. However, the implementation uses 'sorted' to compare the two strings, which checks for both character presence and frequency. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the frequency of characters differs but the unique characters are the same. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return False, which is correct, but 'abcd' and 'dddddddabc' should return False as well, which is also correct. The function fails to meet the requirement of checking for the same unique characters only."
exp_6_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function correctly computes the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion.

exp_6_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This means that a list with duplicate elements, such as [4, 1, 1, 0], is incorrectly classified as monotonically decreasing because it allows for equal elements. The correct implementation should use 'greater than' (>) for increasing and 'less than' (<) for decreasing to ensure strict monotonicity. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([4, 1, 1, 0]) == True' is misleading as it suggests that the function should allow equal elements, which contradicts the definition of monotonicity."
exp_6_HumanEval/58,HumanEval/58,True,CORRECT,"The function 'common' correctly identifies the unique common elements between the two input lists by converting them to sets and using the intersection operator '&'.

exp_6_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operation 'i++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed. The function does not correctly handle the case where the largest prime factor is greater than the square root of n, as it only returns n after the loop, which may not be a prime factor itself. The test cases in the 'check' function also include numbers that are not prime factors of the inputs, leading to incorrect assertions."

The derivative of a polynomial term ax^n is a*n*x^(n-1). The current implementation does not multiply the coefficients by their respective powers, leading to incorrect results for the test cases. For example, the derivative of 3 + 1*x + 2*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 5*x^4 should yield [1, 4, 12, 20] for the first term, but the implementation does not perform this calculation."
exp_6_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function does not correctly handle the base cases for n=0, n=1, and n=2.

According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, it should return the digits reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits, which is correct. However, the test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' is incorrect because the expected output should be '00' (the digits reversed) instead of '001'. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the expected behavior for this test case."

For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because 1 appears once, which is equal to its value, but the function returns 5 instead, as it is the maximum number in the list. The logic should prioritize finding the maximum integer that meets the frequency condition rather than just the maximum integer overall."
exp_6_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'strange_sort_list' function does not correctly alternate between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. After the first minimum and maximum are added to the result, the function continues to append the minimum of the remaining list without alternating back to the maximum. This leads to incorrect results for lists where the minimum and maximum values are not the only elements left. For example, the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should yield [1, 5, 2, 4, 3], but the current implementation will not produce this result correctly. The filtering logic does not ensure that the next value added is the maximum of the remaining integers after each addition."

The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not correspond to any valid formula for calculating the area of a triangle based on its side lengths. The correct formula for the area of a triangle given its sides a, b, and c is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected output for some test cases (like triangle_area(1, 1, 1)) is incorrect based on the area calculation.

Specifically, the function checks if the list is a palindrome after checking the sum, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1] and w is 5, the function would return False because it checks the sum first and does not account for the palindromic condition correctly. The correct order of checks should ensure that both conditions (palindrome and weight) are evaluated properly."
exp_6_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'smallest_change' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic used to calculate the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is flawed.

According to the function description, if one list is empty and the other is not, the empty list should be returned. However, the implementation returns the non-empty list instead. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate([], ['this']) == []' fails because the function will return ['this'] instead of []. Additionally, the assertion 'assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin']' is incorrect because the total characters in the first list (8) is greater than the second list (8), and according to the function's logic, it should return the first list, which is not the expected output."

Additionally, the test cases include assertions that expect the function to return True for numbers like 8 and 10, which are not products of three distinct primes, indicating that the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_6_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will raise a NameError in Python. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is problematic because it incorrectly excludes cases where n is 1, which should return True for any x (since 1 raised to any power is 1). Additionally, the logic for checking if x is a power of n is flawed; it should check if n raised to the power of the integer result of the logarithm equals x, but it should also handle cases where x is not a perfect power of n correctly. The test cases provided in the 'check' function also include a case (is_simple_power(9, 3)) that is expected to return True, but the current implementation would not handle it correctly.

This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues, especially for large integers. For example, 'iscube(1728)' would not return the correct result because the cube root calculation may not yield an exact integer due to rounding errors. A more reliable method would be to compute the integer cube root and then check if cubing that result returns the original number."

The loop and condition used in the function do not properly iterate through the string to check all sets of 3 consecutive characters. Instead, it incorrectly compares segments of the string, which leads to incorrect results for various test cases. For example, 'iopaxioi' should return False, but the current implementation may not evaluate this correctly due to its flawed logic."
exp_6_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the GPA values that are exactly equal to the thresholds defined in the grading table. For example, a GPA of 3.0 should return 'B+', but the current implementation returns 'B' because it uses '>' for comparisons.

exp_6_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' is expected to return True if the length of the input string is a prime number. However, the implementation lacks the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is crucial for determining if a number is prime. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that may not align with the expected prime lengths, such as 'HI' (length 2, which is prime) and 'go' (length 2, which is also prime), but the comments suggest that the function should return False for these cases. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_6_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'starts_one_ends' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for counting n-digit numbers is flawed. The range should be from 10**(n-1) to 10**n to ensure that only n-digit numbers are considered. The current implementation counts all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1, which includes numbers with fewer than n digits. Therefore, the function does not correctly count the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1."
exp_6_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is supposed to return the total sum of the digits of the input integer N when represented in binary, but it incorrectly returns the sum as a string representation of the sum of the binary digits instead of the binary representation of that sum. For example, for N = 150, the sum of the binary digits is 6, but the expected output is '110' (which is the binary representation of 6), not '6'. The assertions in the 'check' function are also incorrect based on the expected outputs."
exp_6_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices of the list. However, the current implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 88])', the expected output is 88 (since 88 is even and at index 1), which is correct. However, in the test case 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the expected output should be 122 (at index 5) but the function would return 5 (at index 1) instead. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_6_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not maintain the original spacing between words in the input string. When the words are sorted and joined back together, the spaces are lost, leading to incorrect output. For example, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation will concatenate the ordered words without preserving the spaces, resulting in 'Hello!!!Wdlor'. Additionally, the function does not handle punctuation correctly, as it does not sort it separately from the words."
exp_6_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the problem statement. The sorting logic combines two separate sorting operations into one return statement, which results in incorrect ordering. The coordinates should first be sorted by rows in ascending order, and then within each row, they should be sorted by columns in descending order. The current implementation does not achieve this because it concatenates two sorted lists instead of sorting the combined list of coordinates based on the specified criteria."
exp_6_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the values rather than the indices. For example, in the case of 'sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6])', the sum of the first and last values is 8 (even), but the function incorrectly sorts based on the indices, leading to incorrect output."

However, the implementation only shifts by 2 positions. For example, the input 'hi' should return 'lm' (which is correct), but the input 'faewfawefaewg' should return 'jeiajeaijeiak' (which is incorrect because it implies a shift of 4). The test cases provided in the check function reveal that the outputs do not match the expected results for several assertions, indicating that the encryption logic is flawed."

For example, in the case of the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], the function returns 1, which is incorrect because the second smallest element does not exist (all elements are the same). The function should return None in this case. Additionally, the test case assert candidate([1, 0**0]) == None is misleading because 0**0 is typically considered to be 1, thus this case would not return None.

The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'boredoms += 1'. Additionally, the method of splitting the string into sentences is flawed because it does not properly handle cases where multiple delimiters are used consecutively or where delimiters are at the end of the string. This could lead to incorrect counts of sentences that start with 'I'. Furthermore, the function does not strip leading whitespace from sentences, which could also affect the correctness of the 'startswith' check."
exp_6_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' has several issues. Firstly, it uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will cause a NameError. Secondly, the condition to check if all numbers are integers is incorrectly placed; it should be checked before performing the addition. Lastly, the function does not account for the case where any of the three numbers could be equal to the sum of the other two, as it only checks if 'x' equals 'y + z'. The correct implementation should check all three combinations: 'x == y + z', 'y == x + z', and 'z == x + y'."
exp_6_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. The logic for replacing vowels is flawed, as it incorrectly calculates the index and adds characters to the encoded message inappropriately. For example, when processing the character 'a', it should replace it with 'c', but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of vowels properly, as it adds an extra character to the encoded message instead of replacing the vowel. This leads to incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."

exp_6_HumanEval/95,HumanEval/95,True,INCORRECT,"The function check_dict_case incorrectly handles the case where the dictionary contains non-string keys. The function should return False if any key is not a string, but the current implementation only checks if all keys are either lower case or upper case. Additionally, the test case assertions include a case with a non-string key (5 in the third test), which should return False, but the implementation does not account for this correctly. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case when n is less than or equal to 2. For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5], but it returns [2, 3, 5] correctly. However, count_up_to(7) should also return [2, 3, 5] but it does not include 7 as it is not less than 7. The function is not returning the correct number of primes for inputs like 6 and 7. Additionally, the test cases include an assertion for count_up_to(6) which is expected to return [2, 3, 5], but the function does not account for the fact that it should return all primes less than n, not just the first n primes. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_6_HumanEval/97,HumanEval/97,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'multiply' is supposed to return the product of the unit digits of the two integers. However, the expected results in the test cases do not match the actual output of the function. For example, 'multiply(148, 412)' should return 32 (8 * 4), but the test expects 16. Similarly, 'multiply(19, 28)' should return 72 (9 * 8), but the test expects 72, which is correct. The function fails to produce the correct output for the first test case and potentially others. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

exp_6_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `closest_integer` does not correctly handle the rounding away from zero for equidistant cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine the closest integer is flawed. The condition `if abs(closest) < abs(0.5 * (closest - value)):` does not correctly implement the rounding away from zero rule. For example, when the input is '14.5', the closest integer should be 15, but the logic may not consistently yield this result. Additionally, the test case for '-15.5' is expected to return -16, but the implementation may not handle negative values correctly due to the flawed logic. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the comments."

For example, when 'n' is 3, the expected output is [3, 5, 7], but the function will produce [3, 3, 5] instead. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for all test cases, particularly for even values of 'n'."

Instead, it should count the number of 1s in the current row only when a 1 is encountered. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where multiple 1s in a row are counted multiple times, leading to an overestimation of the number of times buckets need to be lowered.

Secondly, the sorting logic is flawed: it sorts by the negative count of ones, which is incorrect as it should sort by the count of ones in ascending order and then by the decimal value. The test assertions also indicate that the expected output does not match the actual output of the function. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the assertion checks for [1, 2, 4, 3, 5], which is incorrect."

Additionally, the function does not correctly identify the closest vowel between two consonants, as it only checks the next character after finding a consonant pair. The test cases also reveal that the function does not return the expected results for several inputs, such as `full` and `Above`.

When both inputs are strings, they should be compared as floats after converting them, but the current implementation only converts them if they are not equal. This can lead to incorrect results. For example, compare_one('1', '2') should return '2', but if '1' is compared as a float with '2', it will return 2 instead of '2'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where both inputs are equal strings correctly, as it will convert them to floats and compare them, which may not be the intended behavior."

The correct implementation should check if n can be expressed as the sum of four even numbers, which means n must be at least 8 and even. The test cases provided in the check function indicate that the function should return True for numbers like 10, 12, and 16, but the current implementation does not account for this correctly."

Specifically, it fails to check for the maximum number of digits (3) in the file name and does not ensure that the substring after the dot is one of the allowed extensions ('txt', 'exe', 'dll'). The regex used only checks for a valid format but does not validate the specific conditions outlined in the comments. For example, 'I563_No.exe' should return 'No' because it contains 4 digits, but it currently returns 'Yes'. Additionally, 'this_is_valid.txt' is valid, but the regex does not account for underscores or other characters before the dot, which are not allowed. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as stated."

The function currently squares the integer at index 'i' if 'i' is a multiple of 3, and cubes it if 'i' is a multiple of 4, regardless of whether 'i' is also a multiple of 3. This means that for indices that are multiples of both 3 and 4 (like 12), the function will incorrectly square the value instead of cubing it. This leads to incorrect results for test cases such as candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) which should yield a different sum based on the correct implementation."

For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not a prime number, so it should not be included in the output. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' expects an empty string, which is correct. The function fails to return the expected output for the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""' because 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime lengths, but 'available' (9) is not, so the expected output should be 'there is no place', which is correct. However, the function does not handle the case of words with lengths that are not prime correctly. The function also does not define the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for it to work. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The expression 'x_value * n_value == int(x_value * n_value)' is not a reliable way to check for whole numbers due to potential floating-point precision issues. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in an integer.

Firstly, the method 'filter' is incorrectly used; it should be 'filter' as a function in Python, not as a method on a list. Secondly, the sorting logic is flawed; the function first sorts by length and then sorts alphabetically, which will not maintain the intended order. The correct approach should involve a single sorting operation that considers both length and alphabetical order simultaneously. Additionally, the assumption that all words will have the same length is incorrect as it contradicts the requirement to filter out words based on their lengths.

Additionally, the function incorrectly adds 0 for even numbers, which is unnecessary since it does not affect the result. The test cases provided also indicate that the function does not return the expected results for certain inputs, particularly for the case 'candidate([0.2, 3, 5])' which should return 34 but does not due to the incorrect handling of non-integer values."

However, the test case 'assert candidate([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])==[2,0,0,1]' is also incorrect; the expected output should be [2,0,0,1] which is correct.

Secondly, the function incorrectly uses the 'is_balanced' function (which is not defined in the provided code) to check for nested parentheses, but it should instead be focusing on separating balanced groups. The logic for appending to 'groups' is flawed because it appends the substring from 'start' to 'i' before confirming that it is a complete group. Additionally, there is a syntax error with an extra parenthesis in the line checking 'is_balanced(paren_string[start:])'. Overall, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments and fails to pass the provided test cases."

The assertion for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] should return 1.0, which is correct. However, the assertion for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] should return 6.0/5.0 (1.2), but the assertion checks for the wrong value.

Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be replaced with 'n //= i' to ensure that 'n' remains an integer throughout the factorization process. These issues will cause the function to fail during execution, leading to incorrect results."

However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each number. For example, in the test case remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]), the expected output is [1, 3, 4] because 2 occurs more than once and should be removed entirely. The implementation does not achieve this, as it retains the first occurrence of 2. The assertion assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == [1, 4, 5] also fails because it incorrectly retains the first occurrences of 2 and 3. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

All assertions pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_7_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The function filter_by_prefix is intended to filter strings that start with a given prefix. However, the test assertion check(candidate(['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'], 'xxx') == ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']) is incorrect because the expected output should include 'xxx' and 'xxxAAA', but it should also include the second 'xxx' as it is a valid match. Therefore, the correct expected output should be ['xxx', 'xxx', 'xxxAAA'] instead of ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx']."

This will result in a NameError when the function is called. Additionally, the test cases in the check function include assertions for composite numbers that are not correctly handled by the is_prime function, as it does not account for the case where n is a prime number multiplied by another prime number (e.g., 5 * 17). The function should correctly identify composite numbers as false, but it does not handle the edge cases properly due to the missing import."
exp_7_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the `find_zero` function is incorrect. The function is supposed to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in the list `xs`. However, the formula used to compute the root, `-xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1])`, is only valid for quadratic polynomials (degree 2) and does not generalize to polynomials of higher degrees. Additionally, the function assumes that the coefficients are structured in a way that guarantees a solution, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description. The test assertions in the `check` function are designed to validate the correctness of `find_zero`, but since the function does not handle polynomials of varying degrees correctly, it will fail for any polynomial with a degree greater than 2."

The assertion 'assert candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10]) == 124' is incorrect because the maximum value in that list is actually 124, not 123 as stated in the function's docstring. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed due to the flawed test case."

The function should use 'count += str(i).count('7')' instead to accurately count all instances of '7'."
exp_7_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the values at the even indices. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted list of even-indexed elements to each even index, rather than distributing the sorted values correctly across all even indices. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."

However, the implementation only checks the first n Fibonacci numbers and returns the first one found in the 'primes' list. This means it will not correctly return the n-th prime Fibonacci number for n > 5, as it does not iterate through all Fibonacci numbers beyond the predefined list. For example, 'prime_fib(6)' should return 233, but the current implementation will not reach that point correctly. The function needs to generate Fibonacci numbers dynamically and check for primality until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number."

The nested loops allow for the same element to be used multiple times in the sum, which violates the requirement for distinct elements. For example, if the list contains duplicates, the function could incorrectly return True when it should return False. Additionally, the condition to skip elements equal to zero is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results. The function should instead focus on ensuring that the three selected indices are distinct and that their sum equals zero."
exp_7_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the use of '++' for incrementing the 'collisions' variable, which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The number of collisions should be calculated as n * n (since each car from the left can collide with each car from the right), but the current implementation does not correctly reflect this. The expected output for the test cases is based on the assumption that each car collides with every other car, which is not being correctly calculated in the code."
exp_7_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'incr_list' is correct as it increments each element of the input list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. Specifically, the assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. This discrepancy indicates that the test case is not validating the function correctly, leading to a failure in the overall correctness of the test suite."
exp_7_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function pairs_sum_to_zero is incorrect because it does not properly check for distinct pairs that sum to zero. The nested loop structure allows for the same element to be used twice (i.e., when i and j are the same), which violates the requirement for distinct elements. For example, if the list contains a zero, the function could incorrectly return True if it finds two zeros, which should not be allowed. Additionally, the logic for checking pairs is inefficient and can be simplified using a set to track the required complements. A correct implementation would involve checking if the negative of each element exists in the set of seen elements, ensuring distinctness by only adding elements after checking."
exp_7_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from base 10 to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is incorrect for this purpose. The 'int(x, base)' function is not appropriate here as 'x' is already an integer and should not be interpreted as a string in a different base. Additionally, the 'format' function with 'x' will produce a hexadecimal representation instead of the desired base conversion. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the docstring and fails the test assertions."

Specifically, the test assertions include values for fib4(8), fib4(10), and fib4(12) that are not derived from the correct sequence. The sequence should be calculated based on the defined recurrence relation, but the initial values and the calculations do not align with the expected outputs. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the task."
exp_7_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is mostly correct, but the second test assertion in the check function is incorrect. The expected median for the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] is 10.0, not 8.0. Therefore, the function fails this test case, indicating that the implementation does not correctly compute the median for all inputs."

The provided test cases in the 'check' function cover various scenarios, including empty strings, odd-length palindromes, even-length palindromes, and non-palindromic strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected according to the defined requirements."
exp_7_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which can lead to incorrect results for large values of n due to potential overflow issues in languages with fixed integer sizes. In Python, integers can grow arbitrarily large, but the performance may degrade for very large n. The test cases provided in the check function include edge cases that the implementation does not handle correctly, particularly for larger values of n. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate(30, 5) == 4' fails because 2^30 % 5 equals 4, which is correct, but the implementation may not be efficient for larger values. Therefore, while the implementation may work for the provided test cases, it is not optimal and may not handle all edge cases correctly."
exp_7_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels is intended to remove all vowels from the input string, but it only checks for lowercase vowels ('aeiou'). This leads to incorrect behavior for uppercase vowels and fails to remove them. For example, the test case remove_vowels('EcBOO') should return 'cB', but the implementation does not account for uppercase vowels, resulting in 'cB' being returned correctly only due to the specific input. The function should include uppercase vowels ('AEIOU') in its checks to ensure it works correctly for all cases."

The test cases suggest that the function should return True if both strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, 'aabb' and 'aaccc' should return True because they both contain the characters 'a' and 'c', but the current implementation returns False due to differing frequencies."
exp_7_HumanEval/55,HumanEval/55,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the Fibonacci function is correct for the provided test cases, but it does not handle the case when n is less than 1. The Fibonacci sequence is typically defined for n >= 1. Additionally, the function is inefficient for larger values of n due to its exponential time complexity caused by the recursive calls. The test cases include assertions for n = 11 and n = 12, which are valid Fibonacci numbers, but the implementation does not account for input validation or efficiency."

exp_7_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons. This means that it will return True for lists that contain equal consecutive elements, which is not consistent with the typical definition of monotonicity. For example, the list [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False because it is not strictly decreasing, but the current implementation returns True. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as stated in the function's docstring."

It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case when 'n' becomes a prime number itself after the loop. The function should return the largest prime factor found, but it currently returns 'n', which may not be correct if 'n' is prime. The test cases in the 'check' function also include values that are not guaranteed to be non-prime, which could lead to incorrect assertions."

The current code assumes that the number of apples is always the second word and the number of oranges is always the first word, which is not the case. For example, in the input '5 apples and 6 oranges', the code will incorrectly parse the number of apples as '5' and the number of oranges as 'apples', leading to incorrect calculations. The correct approach should involve parsing the string to accurately extract both the number of apples and the number of oranges, which is not done here."
exp_7_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, the logic for updating 'smallest_index' when encountering an even number equal to 'smallest_even' is flawed. The current implementation only updates 'smallest_index' if the index of the current number is smaller than the previously recorded index, which is unnecessary since we are already tracking the smallest even number. The correct behavior should simply return the first occurrence of the smallest even number without needing to check for equality again. This leads to incorrect results in cases where the smallest even number appears multiple times."
exp_7_HumanEval/69,HumanEval/69,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'search' does not correctly handle cases where the greatest integer that meets the criteria is not the maximum integer in the list. The function checks the frequency of each number but does not account for the possibility that a lower number may have a higher frequency than a higher number. For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected result is 1 because 1 appears once, which is equal to its value, while 5 appears four times but does not meet the criteria.

For example, in the test case 'candidate([0,2,2,2,5,5,-5,-5])', the expected output is '[-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2]', but the function will not produce this output due to the way it removes elements from the list. Instead, it will only remove one instance of -5 and one instance of 5, leading to an incorrect order in the final result."

Additionally, the method 'round' is incorrectly called on 'area', which should be 'round(area, 2)'. The test cases also indicate incorrect expected results for some inputs, such as triangle_area(1, 1, 1) which should return approximately 0.43 but the calculation is not correct based on the area formula."

According to the specification, if one list is empty and the other is not, the function should return the non-empty list. However, the implementation returns the empty list in this case. For example, total_match([], ['this']) should return ['this'], but it currently returns []. Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is incorrect because the total character count of both lists is equal (10), so it should return the first list ['hi', 'admin'], which is correct, but the assertion is misleading as it implies the function is correct when it is not.

For example, is_multiply_prime(30) should return True, but the function will incorrectly return False for numbers like 8 and 10, which are not products of three primes. Additionally, the assertion for candidate(125) should fail since 125 is not a product of three primes (it is 5^3). The logic for checking the multiplication of three primes is missing entirely."

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x is less than n properly, which can lead to incorrect results. The test cases also include assertions that contradict the function's logic, such as 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True', which is incorrect since 9 is 3 squared. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

However, the function does not handle cases where the binary representation is less than 8 bits correctly, as it pads with zeros to always make it 8 bits long.

For example, for N = 1000, the sum of the binary digits is 1, which is correct, but for N = 150, the sum is 6, which should be returned as '110', but the function returns 6 as an integer. The same issue occurs for other test cases."

However, the implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the test case 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the function would return 5 + 7 + 122 = 134, but it should only sum the even numbers at odd indices, which would be 122. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_7_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not preserve the spaces between words in the output.

exp_7_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'get_row' does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the function description. The current sorting logic combines two separate sorting operations: first sorting by row in ascending order and then sorting by column in descending order. This results in an incorrect final list of coordinates. Instead, the coordinates should be sorted by row first, and then for each row, the coordinates should be sorted by column in descending order. The correct approach would involve grouping the coordinates by row and then sorting each group by column before concatenating the results."
exp_7_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices (array[0] and array[-1]). This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the values rather than the indices. For example, for the input [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last values (2 + 6) is 8 (even), so it should sort in descending order, which it does. However, for the input [21, 14, 23, 11], the sum of the first and last values (21 + 11) is 32 (even), but the expected output is incorrect as it does not match the expected descending order. The test cases that rely on the sum of the values will fail due to this logic error."

However, the implementation only shifts by 2 positions. For example, the input 'hi' should return 'lm' (correct), but the input 'faewfawefaewg' returns 'jeiajeaijeiak' instead of the expected 'jeiajeaijeiak' due to incorrect shifting. Additionally, the test cases provided do not match the expected outputs based on the described functionality. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements as stated in the comments."

For example, in the test case next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the function should return 1 as the second smallest element, but it incorrectly returns None. Additionally, the logic for updating the second smallest element is flawed, as it does not account for duplicates correctly. The function should ensure that the second smallest is distinct from the smallest."

Additionally, the way sentences are split does not account for the fact that splitting on multiple delimiters will create empty strings in the list. This could lead to incorrect counts of boredoms if there are multiple delimiters in sequence or at the end of the string. The logic for counting sentences that start with 'I' is also flawed because it does not handle leading whitespace before the 'I'. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the function's requirements."

First, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will result in a NameError. Second, the checks for whether the numbers are integers are incorrectly placed; they should be checked before performing the addition. Additionally, the function does not check all combinations of the three numbers to see if one is equal to the sum of the other two. The correct checks should include: x == y + z, y == x + z, and z == x + y. As a result, the function will not return the expected results for all test cases."

Instead of replacing the vowel, it appends the character from the original message at the index (i + 2) to the encoded message. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases. For example, in the case of 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the current implementation does not achieve that."

However, the function does not correctly identify the largest prime number in all cases. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([127, 97, 8192]) == 10', the largest prime is 127, and the sum of its digits should be 1 + 2 + 7 = 10, which is correct. However, the function does not handle cases where the largest prime is not the last number in the list correctly, nor does it handle the case where there are no prime numbers correctly. The function should return 0 in such cases, but it may not do so correctly depending on the input. Additionally, the function does not include the definition of 'is_prime', which is necessary for it to work, leading to potential runtime errors."
exp_7_HumanEval/95,HumanEval/95,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'check_dict_case' does not correctly evaluate whether all keys are either in lower case or upper case. The condition in the return statement uses 'or' which leads to incorrect results. Specifically, it checks if each key is either a string and in lower case or if it is upper case, but it does not ensure that all keys are consistently in one case. The correct approach would be to check if all keys are lower case or all keys are upper case separately, and return True only if one of those conditions is satisfied. Additionally, the test assertions include a case that is not covered by the function's logic, which further indicates that the implementation is flawed."

The expected output is [2, 3, 5], but the function returns [2, 3, 5] which is correct. However, it fails to return the correct primes for n = 7, where the expected output is also [2, 3, 5]. The function does not include 5 when n is 7, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle larger values correctly, as seen in the test case for n = 22, where it should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] but does not include 19. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

The function implementation does not align with the expected behavior as described in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/98,HumanEval/98,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error: 'count++' is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment a variable in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input string is empty correctly, as it will raise an IndexError when trying to access an index that does not exist. Therefore, the function will not pass all the assertions in the test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/100,HumanEval/100,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'make_a_pile' does not correctly generate the number of stones for each level based on whether 'n' is odd or even. The logic used in the loop for appending stones is incorrect. Specifically, it incorrectly calculates the next odd/even number based on the index 'i' rather than the current level's stone count. For example, for n=4, it should start with 4 and add 2 for each subsequent level, resulting in [4, 6, 8, 10], but the current implementation will not yield this result. Therefore, the function fails the provided test cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/101,HumanEval/101,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'words_string' does not correctly handle cases where words are separated by spaces or multiple commas. The current implementation only splits the string by ', ', which means it will fail for inputs like 'One,, two' or 'ahmed     , gamal'. The expected behavior is to split by both commas and spaces, regardless of how many there are. A correct implementation would use a regular expression or a more comprehensive split method to account for various delimiters."

The range function is incorrectly using 'maxOf(x, y)' and 'minOf(x, y)', which are not defined. Instead, it should use 'max(x, y)' and 'min(x, y)'. Additionally, the range should be inclusive of the endpoints, so the correct range should be 'range(max(x, y), min(x, y) - 1, -1)'.

Firstly, the method 'Integer.toBinaryString' is not valid in Python; it should be replaced with 'bin()' to convert an integer to its binary representation. Secondly, the rounding of the average is incorrectly handled; the average should be rounded using Python's built-in 'round()' function. Lastly, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include assertions that will fail due to the incorrect implementation of the average calculation and binary conversion."
exp_7_HumanEval/104,HumanEval/104,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'unique_digits' is incorrect because it attempts to check if all digits of a number are odd by using 'all(d % 2 != 0 for d in str(num))'. However, 'd' is a character (string) when iterating over 'str(num)', and thus 'd % 2' will raise a TypeError. The correct approach would be to convert 'd' back to an integer before performing the modulus operation. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([12345, 2033, 111, 151]) == [111, 151]' is expected to return [111, 151] but will fail because '12345' contains an even digit (2).

The current implementation sorts the entire array, including negative numbers and numbers greater than 9, which leads to incorrect results. For example, in the case of the input [1, -1, 55], the sorted array becomes [-1, 1, 55], and reversing it gives [55, 1, -1]. The function then only returns ['One'], which is incorrect because it should ignore -1 and 55 and return ['One'] after sorting and reversing the valid numbers. The implementation needs to filter the input array first to only include numbers between 1 and 9 before sorting and reversing."

The expected output should be [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28], but the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is incorrectly stated as 15 instead of 15. The expected output for n=5 is also incorrect; it should be [1, 2, 6, 24, 15] as per the description, but the test case does not match the expected behavior of the function.

However, this is inefficient and does not account for the fact that the array can only be sorted if it is a rotated version of a sorted array. The correct approach would involve checking if the array can be split into two parts where the first part is greater than the second part, and the maximum of the first part is less than or equal to the minimum of the second part. The test case 'move_one_ball([3, 5, 10, 1, 2])' should return False, but the current implementation returns True, indicating a flaw in logic."

This leads to incorrect results in cases where there are letters with different frequencies. For example, in the case of 'a b b a', the expected output is {'a': 2, 'b': 2}, but the implementation may not return this correctly due to the flawed logic. The function should only check for the maximum occurrence and return those letters, not the minimum."

Additionally, the test cases provided in the 'check' function include a case where the input string 'a' with character 'a' results in an empty string, which is incorrectly marked as a palindrome. An empty string is considered a palindrome, but the expected output should be ('', True) as per the definition. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."

Specifically, it checks if the current character is a consonant, the next character is a vowel, and the character after that is a consonant. This means it will miss cases where the vowel is immediately followed by a consonant. Additionally, the function converts the entire word to uppercase, which causes it to lose the case sensitivity required by the problem statement. The test cases also reveal that the function does not return the expected results for several inputs, such as 'full' and 'Above'.

For example, in the test case candidate([1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99], 3), the expected output is -4 (sum of 1 and -2), but the function would incorrectly sum the first three elements (1, -2, -3) and return -4, which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed for other cases. Additionally, the test case candidate([11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9], 4) expects a sum of 125, but the function would only sum 11, 21, and 3, which totals 35, leading to an assertion failure.

For example, the assertion for candidate(14) expects [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17], which does not match the odd numbers that would actually appear in the Collatz sequence for 14. The correct odd numbers from the Collatz sequence for 14 should be [1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described."

The function returns 'NO' for this case, which is correct, but it also incorrectly returns 'YES' for the intersection of (-3, -1) and (-5, 5), which has a length of 3 (which is prime). The test case 'intersection((-2, 2), (-4, 0))' is also incorrect as it should return 'NO' since the intersection is (-2, 0) with a length of 3, which is prime.

For example, in the test case can_arrange([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10]), the expected output is 2 (since 2 is less than 4), but the function returns 1 (the index of 4). Additionally, the test case can_arrange([1,2,4,5]) is expected to return -1, which is correct, but the logic fails for other cases. The function should be revised to ensure it correctly identifies the largest index as specified in the function description."
exp_7_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the smallest positive integer. In the implementation, the condition for updating `pos_int` is incorrect; it should check if the number is greater than `pos_int` instead of less than. This leads to incorrect results for cases where there are positive integers present. For example, in the test case `largest_smallest_integers([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, -2])`, the expected output is (-2, 1), but the function will return (-2, None) because it fails to update `pos_int` correctly."

Specifically, it converts strings to floats but does not account for the case where the string representation of a number might be compared with a numeric type. For example, '2,3' is converted to 2.3, but when comparing '1' (which becomes 1.0) with 1, it returns None instead of the expected behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the inputs are equal but represented differently (e.g., '1' and 1). The test cases also do not cover all possible edge cases, such as comparing two strings that represent the same number but are formatted differently."
exp_7_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_equal_to_sum_even is incorrectly implemented. It only checks if n is equal to the sum of the first four positive even numbers (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20). However, the task requires checking if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The correct implementation should consider all combinations of four positive even numbers that sum to n, rather than just checking against a fixed sum. Therefore, the assertions in the check function will not yield the expected results for all cases."
exp_7_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' does not correctly compute the Brazilian factorial as defined in the comments. The function currently only calculates the regular factorial of 'n', which is 'n!'. However, the Brazilian factorial requires the product of all factorials from 'n!' down to '1!'. Therefore, the correct implementation should involve a loop that calculates the factorial for each integer from 'n' down to '1' and multiplies them together. The test cases provided will fail because the function does not produce the expected results for the Brazilian factorial."

The regex pattern used replaces all consecutive spaces with a single '-' if there are more than 2 spaces, but it does not replace single spaces with underscores as required. For example, the test case 'Mudasir Hanif ' should return 'Mudasir_Hanif_' but instead it would return 'Mudasir-Hanif_' due to the incorrect handling of single spaces. Additionally, the test case 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow' should return 'Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow' but it would not due to the same issue. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

Specifically, the check for the starting character of the file name is flawed. The condition 'if not file_name.startswith(string.ascii_letters) or not file_name[1].isalpha()' is incorrect because it checks if the file name starts with any letter and then checks if the second character is an alphabetic character, which is not necessary. The first character should be checked directly instead. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the file name has more than one dot correctly, as it only checks the count of dots after checking for digits. This leads to incorrect results for some test cases, such as 'this_is_valid.txt' which should return 'Yes' but may not due to the flawed logic. Furthermore, the function does not correctly handle cases where the substring after the dot is not one of the allowed extensions. Overall, the implementation fails to meet the specified criteria, leading to incorrect outputs."

Specifically, the function squares elements at indices that are multiples of 3, but it also incorrectly cubes elements at indices that are multiples of 4 without checking if they are not multiples of 3. This leads to incorrect results for test cases where indices are both multiples of 3 and 4. For example, at index 12, the value should be cubed (if it were not also a multiple of 3), but the current implementation will square it instead. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030' is incorrect based on the function's logic, which leads to further discrepancies in the expected output."

For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not a prime number, so it should not return any words. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' is expected to return an empty string, which is correct. The issue arises with the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""', where 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime lengths, but the implementation does not account for the word 'available' (9), which is not prime.

The current implementation checks if the product of the decimal values of the fractions is an integer, which can lead to floating-point precision issues. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in a whole number. Specifically, it should check if (x_numerator * n_numerator) % (x_denominator * n_denominator) == 0 to determine if the result is a whole number."

The correct way to extract the first digit would involve converting the number to a string or using integer division. Therefore, the function will not return the expected results for the provided test cases."

For example, calling bf('Neptune', 'Venus') should return ('Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus') but instead returns an empty tuple because the current implementation only considers the index of planet1 to be less than that of planet2. Additionally, the function does not check for the case where the two planets are the same, which should return an empty tuple according to the function description."
exp_7_HumanEval/149,HumanEval/149,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sorted_list_sum' contains syntax errors and logical flaws. Firstly, the method 'filter' is incorrectly used; it should be 'filter()' in Python, and it should be applied to a list, not as a method on the list itself. Secondly, the sorting logic is flawed; it first sorts by length and then sorts alphabetically, which will not maintain the length-based sorting as intended. The correct approach should involve a single sorting operation that considers both length and alphabetical order. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to filter out strings with odd lengths. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

Without the definition of is_prime, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n is less than 2 correctly, as 1 is not a prime number and should return y, but the implementation does not explicitly check for this. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_7_HumanEval/151,HumanEval/151,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'double_the_difference' does not correctly handle the requirements specified in the docstring. Specifically, it fails to ignore non-integer values correctly and does not return the sum of squares of odd integers as intended. For example, the test case 'assert candidate([5, 4]) == 25' fails because the function does not account for the fact that only the odd number (5) should contribute to the sum, resulting in a return value of 0 instead of 25. Additionally, the check for non-integer values is incorrect; the condition 'not num % 1 == 0' does not effectively filter out non-integer types. The function should use 'isinstance(num, int)' to ensure only integers are processed."

The test case 'compare([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])' is expected to return [2,4,6], which indicates the absolute difference between the actual scores and the negative guesses. However, the implementation does not account for negative guesses correctly, as it only checks the absolute difference without considering the context of the game scores. Therefore, the function does not pass all assertions, leading to an incorrect evaluation."
exp_7_HumanEval/153,HumanEval/153,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'Strongest_Extension' is missing the definitions for the helper functions 'count_uppercase' and 'count_lowercase'. Without these functions, the code will raise a NameError when trying to execute. Additionally, the logic for handling the case where two extensions have the same strength is flawed; it compares the extensions lexicographically, which is not specified in the problem statement. The problem requires returning the first extension in the list with the same strength, not the lexicographically smaller one."
exp_7_HumanEval/154,HumanEval/154,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'cycpattern_check' is supposed to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word or its reverse is in the first word, which does not account for rotations. For example, 'cycpattern_check(""abab"", ""baa"")' should return True because 'baa' is a rotation of 'abab', but the function will return False. Additionally, the test cases in the 'check' function include cases that are not handled correctly by 'cycpattern_check', such as 'cycpattern_check(""efef"", ""fee"")' which should return True but will not be correctly evaluated by the current implementation."

Firstly, the increment operators '++' are not valid in Python; they should be replaced with '+=' to correctly increment the counts. Secondly, the division operation 'num /= 10' will convert 'num' to a float, which can lead to incorrect behavior when checking the digits. Instead, integer division 'num //= 10' should be used. Lastly, the return statement uses 'Pair' which is not defined in the code; it should return a tuple directly using '(count_even, count_odd)'. These errors lead to incorrect results and will cause the function to fail during execution."

For example, the test case int_to_mini_roman(251) is expected to return 'cccli', but the implementation returns 'ccli', which is incorrect. The logic for constructing the Roman numeral string is flawed, as it does not account for the correct combination of hundreds, tens, and units.

The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with sides a, b, and hypotenuse c, the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 must hold true, where c is the longest side. The current implementation assumes c is always the longest side, which is not guaranteed. For example, right_angle_triangle(6, 8, 10) would return False, but it should return True since 6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2. The function should first determine the longest side and then apply the Pythagorean theorem accordingly."

Specifically, when the total (number + need) is greater than remaining, the function should return the total eaten carrots as 'number + remaining' and the remaining carrots as '0'. However, it incorrectly returns 'remaining' instead of '0' when the total is less than or equal to remaining. This leads to incorrect outputs for the test cases provided."

For example, in the test case with operators ['**', '*', '+'] and operands [2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result is calculated as 2 ** 3 * 4 + 5, which should yield 37. However, the function evaluates the operations strictly from left to right without considering that exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication and addition. This leads to incorrect results in cases where operator precedence matters."

According to the problem statement, if the string contains no letters, the function should reverse the string. However, the current implementation only reverses the case of letters and does not reverse the string when there are no letters. For example, the input '1234' should return '4321', which is correct, but the function fails to handle cases like '!!!' where it should return '!!!' as it contains no letters, but it would return an empty string instead."

However, the test assertions in the 'check' function include expected MD5 hash values that are incorrect for the provided inputs. For example, the MD5 hash for 'A B C' and 'password' do not match the expected values in the assertions. Therefore, while the function itself is implemented correctly, the tests do not validate the function properly due to incorrect expected values."

The expected behavior is to return the even digits between 'a' and 'b' in ascending order, but the implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without considering the order. For example, 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return an empty list, but the function will not handle this case correctly. Additionally, the test cases are incorrect; 'generate_integers(10, 2)' should return [] but the assertion expects [2, 4, 6, 8]. The function also does not account for the case where 'a' and 'b' are equal, which should return [a] if 'a' is even or an empty list if 'a' is odd."

Firstly, the function does not correctly handle the separation of groups of parentheses. The logic for appending to the 'groups' list is flawed; it appends the substring from 'start' to 'i' whenever it encounters an opening parenthesis, which does not accurately reflect the balanced groups. Additionally, the function incorrectly checks for balance using 'is_balanced' without defining this function, leading to a NameError. Furthermore, the final check for balance has an extra closing parenthesis, causing a syntax error. The test cases provided in the 'check' function expect the output to be a list of separate balanced groups, but the current implementation does not achieve this."
exp_8_HumanEval/2,HumanEval/2,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'truncate_number' is incorrect because the method 'modf()' returns a tuple where the first element is the decimal part and the second element is the integer part.

The correct implementation should return 'integer_part' instead of 'decimals'."
exp_8_HumanEval/3,HumanEval/3,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'below_zero' incorrectly handles withdrawal operations. When an operation is negative (indicating a withdrawal), the code subtracts the operation from the balance using 'balance -= operation', which effectively adds the absolute value of the operation to the balance instead of subtracting it. The correct operation should be 'balance += operation' for negative values, or 'balance -= abs(operation)'. This leads to incorrect balance calculations and incorrect results for certain test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/4,HumanEval/4,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the mean_absolute_deviation function is correct in terms of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). However, the test assertions in the check function are incorrect. The expected results for the test cases do not match the correct MAD values.

The second assertion is also correct, as the MAD for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] is indeed 1.0. However, the third assertion's expected value of 6.0/5.0 (1.2) is incorrect; the correct MAD for [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] is 1.2. Therefore, the overall evaluation is INCORRECT due to the incorrect expected values in the assertions."

The logic used in the for loop causes the delimiter to be added incorrectly. Specifically, the condition 'if i % 2 != 0 or i != len(numbers) - 1' leads to the delimiter being added after the last element, which is not intended. For example, calling 'intersperse([2, 2, 2], 2)' results in '[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]' instead of the expected '[2, 2, 2, 2]'.

However, the expected output for the test case 'check' is incorrect. For example, the assertion 'assert candidate(['grunt', 'trumpet', 'prune', 'gruesome'], 'run') == ['grunt', 'prune']' is incorrect because 'gruesome' also contains 'run'.

However, when the list contains a zero (as in the test case [100, 0]), the product should be 0, but the current implementation will incorrectly return 0 for the product when it should return 1 for the empty product case.

This is evident in the test cases where inputs like 3 and 7 should return 1, but the current implementation would return 3 and 7 respectively. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."
exp_8_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'i++', which is not valid in Python. The correct increment operation should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be replaced with 'n //= i' to ensure integer division, as we are dealing with factors. These issues will prevent the function from executing correctly and returning the expected results."
exp_8_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_duplicates is intended to remove all elements that occur more than once from the input list. However, the implementation only removes duplicates while keeping the first occurrence of each number. For example, in the test case candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]), the expected output is [1, 4, 5], but the function will return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] instead. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not meet the specified requirement."
exp_8_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'flip_case' correctly flips the case of each alphabetic character in the input string while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

However, the test assertion check(candidate) includes a case where it expects the output to include 'xxx' and 'xxxAAA' when filtering with the prefix 'xxx'. The function correctly identifies 'xxx' but incorrectly includes 'xxxAAA' because it does not start with 'xxx' (it starts with 'xxxA'). Therefore, the expected output in the assertion does not match the actual output of the function."
exp_8_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,INCORRECT,"The function get_positive is designed to return only positive numbers from the input list. However, the second test assertion in the check function is incorrect because it expects the output to include the number 3 twice, which is not consistent with the function's purpose. The correct output for the input [5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] should be [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1] as it includes all positive numbers, but the presence of duplicates is not an issue. The function itself is correct in its implementation, but the test cases provided do not accurately reflect the expected behavior of the function."

It returns False for numbers less than or equal to 1, checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n, and returns True for prime numbers. The test assertions in the check function cover various cases, including edge cases and composite numbers, and they all pass successfully, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_8_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function is supposed to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in the list 'xs'. However, the formula used to calculate the root, '-xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1])', is only valid for quadratic polynomials (degree 2) and does not generalize to polynomials of higher degrees. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the polynomial has multiple roots or does not have a real root. The test cases provided in the docstring also imply that the function should handle polynomials of varying degrees, which it currently does not. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly implement the intended behavior. The requirement is to sort the values at indices that are divisible by three while keeping the other values unchanged. However, the current implementation sorts the entire list and replaces values at indices divisible by three with the sorted values from the entire list, which is not the correct approach. For example, in the test case sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]), the expected output is [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], but the implementation does not achieve this because it uses the sorted version of the entire list instead of just the values at the specified indices."
exp_8_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the requirement to return sorted unique elements from a list.

Therefore, the function will not return the expected results, leading to failed assertions in the check function."
exp_8_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_even' does not correctly sort the values at the even indices. The line 'l_sorted[i] = sorted(l[i::2])[0]' only assigns the smallest value from the sorted even-indexed elements to each even index, rather than replacing each even index with the sorted values in the correct order. This leads to incorrect results, as seen in the provided test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'check' is incorrectly testing the 'encode_cyclic' function instead of the 'decode_cyclic' function. The assertion should check if 'decode_cyclic' correctly decodes the encoded string back to the original string. Additionally, the implementation of 'decode_cyclic' is identical to 'encode_cyclic', which means it will not correctly decode the string. The logic for encoding and decoding should be different, as decoding should reverse the encoding process."
exp_8_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function prime_fib does not correctly return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. The implementation only checks the first few Fibonacci numbers (up to the 10th) and does not generate Fibonacci numbers beyond the hardcoded list. Additionally, the logic for checking if a Fibonacci number is prime is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that if a Fibonacci number is not found in the primes list, it is prime without proper primality testing. This leads to incorrect results for inputs greater than 5, as seen in the test assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the distinctness of the elements being considered for the sum. The use of the 'seen' set is flawed; once an element is added to 'seen', it prevents the same element from being used in subsequent iterations, which is not the intended behavior. The function should check for distinct elements only when forming the triplet (a, b, c) and not restrict the selection of elements based on previous selections. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the same number can be part of different combinations. For example, the input [1, 3, -2, 1] should return True because 1, -2, and -1 can form a valid triplet, but the current logic may skip valid combinations due to the 'seen' set logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains several issues. Firstly, the syntax for incrementing the 'collisions' variable is incorrect; it uses '++' which is not valid in Python. It should be 'collisions += 1'. Secondly, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The function does not correctly simulate the conditions under which cars collide, as it relies on incorrect comparisons and breaks out of loops prematurely. The expected output for the test cases is based on the assumption that each car from one direction collides with every car from the opposite direction, which should yield n*n collisions. However, the current implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results."
exp_8_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is correctly implemented to increment each element of the input list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. The expected output is correct, but the test case does not match the expected behavior of the function as described in the docstring. Therefore, the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed due to the flawed test case."
exp_8_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pairs_sum_to_zero' is incorrect because it calls itself recursively with two arguments, which is not defined in the function signature. The function is supposed to check for pairs of distinct elements that sum to zero, but the logic does not correctly implement this. The current implementation will lead to a TypeError due to the incorrect number of arguments in the recursive call. Additionally, the logic for checking pairs is not correctly implemented; it does not check for the presence of the negative counterpart of each number in the set."
exp_8_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from base 10 to a specified base (less than 10). However, the implementation uses 'int(x, base)' which is incorrect because 'x' is already an integer and does not need to be converted from a string representation. Additionally, the format specifier 'x' in 'format(..., 'x')' converts the number to hexadecimal, not to the specified base. Therefore, the function does not produce the expected results for the test cases provided."

However, the test assertions indicate that the expected values for fib4(8), fib4(10), and fib4(12) are incorrect based on the provided recursive definition. The function does not account for the correct summation of the previous four terms as specified, leading to incorrect results for larger values of n. The expected values from the test assertions do not match the output of the function, indicating that the implementation is flawed."

All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_8_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'modp' does not correctly handle large values of 'n' due to the potential for integer overflow when calculating '2 ** n'. While Python can handle large integers, the calculation can become inefficient and may not yield the correct result for very large 'n' when combined with the modulo operation. The test cases provided do not cover edge cases for large 'n', and the function could be optimized using modular exponentiation to avoid these issues."

The `encode_shift` function shifts characters by 5 positions, but it does not handle characters outside the lowercase alphabet correctly. For example, if the input string contains uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters, the function will raise an error or produce incorrect results. Additionally, the `decode_shift` function has a similar issue. The test assertions in the `check` function are designed to validate the decoding process, but since the encoding function is flawed, the decoding will also fail. Therefore, the overall implementation does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The function remove_vowels does not handle uppercase vowels correctly. The test cases include inputs with uppercase vowels, and the function only checks for lowercase vowels. For example, the input 'EcBOO' should return 'cB', but the current implementation would incorrectly return 'cB' since it does not account for uppercase vowels. Additionally, the test case 'fedcba' is not covered in the function's docstring, which could lead to confusion about the expected behavior."

exp_8_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) comparisons, which means it will return True for lists that contain equal elements as well. This is not consistent with the typical definition of monotonicity, which usually requires strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequences. For example, the input [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False because it is not strictly decreasing. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as described in the comments."

exp_8_HumanEval/59,HumanEval/59,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operator 'i++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case when the remaining value of 'n' is a prime number itself after the loop. The function should return the largest prime factor found, which may not be the final value of 'n' if it is greater than 1. The test cases also include numbers that are not guaranteed to be composite, which could lead to incorrect assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/60,HumanEval/60,True,INCORRECT,"The function sum_to_n is intended to sum all integers from 1 to n. The implementation uses the formula n * (n + 1) / 2, which is mathematically correct for calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers.

For example, for the polynomial represented by [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the correct derivative should be [1*1, 2*2, 3*4, 4*5] which results in [1, 4, 12, 20]. However, the current implementation simply returns the coefficients starting from the second element, which does not reflect the correct derivative calculation."
exp_8_HumanEval/63,HumanEval/63,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the fibfib function is incorrect because it does not return the expected values for the FibFib sequence. Specifically, the base cases are not handled correctly. The function returns 'n' for inputs less than 3, which is not aligned with the expected output of fibfib(0) == 0, fibfib(1) == 0, and fibfib(2) == 1. The correct implementation should return 0 for fibfib(0) and fibfib(1), and 1 for fibfib(2). The test cases in the check function will fail for fibfib(0) and fibfib(2) due to this issue."
exp_8_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not account for uppercase vowels, as the string 'vowels' is defined in lowercase. The test cases also do not cover all scenarios, such as words with 'y' at the end or mixed case inputs. Therefore, the function will not return the correct counts for all inputs as described in the comments."

According to the description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is greater than or equal to the length of the digits. This causes the function to return incorrect results for cases where the shift is exactly equal to the number of digits, such as in the test case 'circular_shift(12, 2)', which should return '12' but is handled correctly. However, the test case 'circular_shift(100, 2)' returns '001', which is incorrect because the expected behavior for a shift of 2 should be to reverse the digits, resulting in '001'. Thus, the implementation fails to meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

exp_8_HumanEval/68,HumanEval/68,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'pluck' does not correctly handle the case where multiple even numbers have the same smallest value. Specifically, it does not update the smallest index correctly when encountering an even number that is equal to the current smallest even number. The condition 'elif node % 2 == 0 and node == smallest_even' is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 4, 8, 4 ,8]) == [4, 1]', the function would return [4, 3] instead of the expected [4, 1] because it does not properly track the first occurrence of the smallest even value.

For example, in the test case 'search([5, 5, 5, 5, 1])', the expected output is 1 because 1 appears once, which is equal to its value, but the function returns -1 instead. Additionally, the function uses 'lst.count(num)' which is inefficient as it traverses the list multiple times, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2). A more efficient approach would be to use a dictionary to count frequencies in a single pass."
exp_8_HumanEval/70,HumanEval/70,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'strange_sort_list' function does not correctly handle the case where there are duplicate minimum or maximum values. For example, in the case of the input [0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, -5, -5], the expected output is [-5, 5, -5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2], but the function will not produce this result because it removes the first occurrence of the minimum and maximum values without considering duplicates. This leads to incorrect ordering in the output."
exp_8_HumanEval/71,HumanEval/71,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the triangle_area function incorrectly calculates the area of the triangle. The formula used, (float(a * b * c) ** (1 / 2)) / 4, does not yield the correct area for a triangle given its three sides. The correct formula to calculate the area of a triangle using its sides is Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). Additionally, the expected area for the triangle with sides (1, 1, 1) should be approximately 0.43, but using Heron's formula, it should be approximately 0.866, which is not returned by the current implementation."
exp_8_HumanEval/72,HumanEval/72,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the list is balanced but the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight. Specifically, the function checks if the list is a palindrome after checking the sum against the weight, but it does not ensure that both conditions (being a palindrome and the sum being less than or equal to the weight) are satisfied before returning True. The function will return True if the list is a palindrome, regardless of the sum condition, which is incorrect. For example, the input [1, 2, 1] with weight 5 should return True, but it would return False due to the sum being 4, which is less than the weight but the function does not check for the sum condition before confirming it's balanced."
exp_8_HumanEval/73,HumanEval/73,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `smallest_change` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

For example, in the case of `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])`, the function returns 4, but it does not account for all mismatches throughout the array. The correct approach should involve counting all mismatches between the elements from the start and the end of the array until the middle is reached, and each mismatch would require one change. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

Additionally, the test case assert candidate(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hii']) == ['hi', 'admin'] is incorrect because the total character count of the first list (10) is greater than that of the second list (9), so it should return ['hI', 'hi', 'hii'] instead."

The function should instead factor 'a' and check if it can be expressed as a product of exactly three prime numbers. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that are not valid based on the function's description, such as 'assert candidate(8) == True' (8 = 2 * 2 * 2, which is not a product of three distinct primes) and 'assert candidate(125) == True' (125 = 5 * 5 * 5, which is also not a product of three distinct primes). Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_8_HumanEval/76,HumanEval/76,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_simple_power' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will result in a NameError. Secondly, the condition 'int(math.log(x, n)) != 0' is incorrect because it excludes cases where n is 1, which should return True for any x (since n**0 = 1). Additionally, the logic for checking if x is a simple power of n is flawed; it does not account for cases where x is not an exact power of n. The test cases provided in the 'check' function also include assertions that would fail based on the incorrect implementation, such as 'assert candidate(9, 3)==True', which is false since 9 is 3**2.

The expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' does not reliably determine if 'a' is a perfect cube due to floating-point precision issues. For example, 'iscube(1729)' should return False, but the test case checks 'candidate(1728)', which is not the same. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers correctly, as the cube root of a negative number is also negative, and the current implementation does not account for this.

Additionally, the condition 'all(s[j:j + 3] != s[j + 3:j + 6] for j in range(0, len(s) - i + 1))' is flawed as it does not ensure that all sets of 3 consecutive characters are distinct. Instead, it only compares non-overlapping groups of 3 characters, which is not the requirement. Therefore, the function will fail for various test cases, such as 'iopaxioi', which should return False but may not due to the incorrect logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/81,HumanEval/81,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'numerical_letter_grade' does not correctly handle the GPA values according to the grading table provided in the comments. Specifically, the function incorrectly assigns the letter grade 'D+' for a GPA of 1.2, while it should assign 'D'. Additionally, the function does not account for the case where a GPA of exactly 0.0 should return 'E', which is correctly handled in the test cases. The test cases also include a GPA of 1.2, which should return 'D', but the function does not implement this correctly."
exp_8_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'prime_length' is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if a number is prime. Specifically, it fails to check for divisibility by numbers greater than 1 and less than the square root of the string length. For example, the string length of 9 (from 'kittens') is incorrectly identified as prime because the function checks divisibility only up to 8. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the string length is 2 correctly, as 2 is a prime number but would return False due to the loop starting from 2 and not checking for divisibility. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function that depend on the correctness of 'prime_length' will yield incorrect results."
exp_8_HumanEval/83,HumanEval/83,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'starts_one_ends' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic used to count the numbers that start or end with '1' is flawed because it does not correctly account for the range of n-digit integers. The range should be from 10**(n-1) to 10**n, not from 0 to 10**n. Therefore, the function will not return the correct counts for the test cases provided."
exp_8_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the sum of the digits of the binary representation of N, but it incorrectly returns the sum as a binary string. For example, for N = 150, the binary representation is '10010110', and the sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0) is 6, which should be returned as '110' in binary. However, the function returns '6' as a string instead of '110'. The test cases in 'check' also expect incorrect outputs based on the function's logic."
exp_8_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices in the list. However, the implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the case of 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the function would return 5 + 7 = 12 instead of 122, which is the only even number at an odd index. The test cases provided in the 'check' function do not validate the requirement of summing only even numbers at odd indices, leading to incorrect results."
exp_8_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The function anti_shuffle does not maintain the spaces between words in the output. When the words are sorted and joined together without spaces, the original structure of the sentence is lost. For example, the input 'Hello World!!!' should return 'Hello !!!Wdlor', but the current implementation will return 'Hello!!!Wdlor', which is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle punctuation correctly, as it does not sort punctuation marks separately from words."
exp_8_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the requirements. The current implementation concatenates two sorted lists: one sorted by row in ascending order and another sorted by column in descending order. Instead, the coordinates should be sorted first by row in ascending order and then, for each row, by column in descending order. This means that the sorting should be done in a single step, not by combining two separate sorts."

It uses the indices (0 and len(array) - 1) instead of the values at those indices. This leads to incorrect sorting behavior based on the sum of the values at the first and last indices. For example, in the case of the array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the first index value is 2 and the last index value is 6, which sum to 8 (even), but the function incorrectly sorts based on the indices instead, leading to incorrect output."

However, the implementation only shifts by 2 positions. For example, 'h' should become 'l' (shifted by 4), but the implementation correctly shifts it to 'j' (shifted by 2). The test cases provided also expect the output based on a 4-position shift, which leads to failures in the assertions. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_8_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,True,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly handle cases where the second smallest element is the same as the smallest element. For example, in the test case next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected result is None since there is no distinct second smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the test case next_smallest([-35, 34, 12, -45]) should return -35 as the second smallest element, but the function will return -45 instead, as it does not account for the ordering correctly after sorting. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function description."

Additionally, the logic for counting sentences that start with 'I' is flawed because it only checks for sentences split by '.' and does not account for sentences ending with '?' or '!'. The sentences should be split by all three delimiters ('.', '?', '!') to correctly identify the sentences. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail to pass the provided test assertions."
exp_8_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'any_int' contains several issues. Firstly, the function uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will lead to a NameError. Secondly, the check for whether the numbers are integers is done incorrectly; it uses 'is_integer()' method which is valid for float objects but not for integers. The function should check if all inputs are instances of 'int' instead. Lastly, the logic for checking if one number equals the sum of the other two is correct, but due to the aforementioned issues, the function will not work as intended."
exp_8_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. Instead of replacing the vowel with the correct letter, it mistakenly appends a character from the original message based on its index. For example, in the case of 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the implementation incorrectly adds the character at the index (i + 2) of the original message. Additionally, the case swapping is done correctly, but the vowel replacement logic is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs in the test cases."

However, the function does not handle the case where there are no prime numbers correctly. In such cases, it returns 0, which is not the expected behavior according to the examples provided. Additionally, the function does not define the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for it to work. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_8_HumanEval/95,HumanEval/95,False,INCORRECT,"The function check_dict_case does not correctly handle the case where the dictionary contains non-string keys. In Python, non-string keys (like integers) will cause the islower() and isupper() methods to raise an AttributeError, as these methods are not defined for non-string types. The test case check_dict_case({'p':'pineapple', 5:'banana', 'a':'apple'}) should return False, but the implementation will raise an error instead. Additionally, the test case check(candidate({'fruit':'Orange', 'taste':'Sweet'})) is incorrectly labeled as 'Fourth test error' in the assertions, which is misleading. The function should also return False for this case since the keys are not all in the same case. Therefore, the implementation is not robust against non-string keys and fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_8_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_up_to is supposed to return an array of the first n prime numbers that are less than n. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where n is less than or equal to 1, as it returns an empty list in these cases. Additionally, the function does not limit the number of primes returned to 'the first n primes', but rather returns all primes less than n. For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5], which is correct, but count_up_to(7) should also return [2, 3, 5] which is correct, but count_up_to(10) should return [2, 3, 5, 7] which is also correct. However, the function does not limit the output to the first n primes, which is a requirement. The test cases also include assertions that expect the function to return a specific number of primes, which the current implementation does not guarantee."

However, the expected outputs in the comments for the test cases do not match the actual outputs of the function. For example, multiply(148, 412) should return 8 (unit digits are 8 and 2, and 8 * 2 = 16), but the function correctly computes this. However, for multiply(19, 28), the expected output is 72, but the unit digits are 9 and 8, which gives 72, so this is correct. The test case multiply(14, -15) should return 20 (unit digits are 4 and 5, which gives 20), which is also correct. However, the test case multiply(76, 67) should return 42 (unit digits are 6 and 7, which gives 42), which is correct. The test case multiply(17, 27) should return 49 (unit digits are 7 and 7, which gives 49), which is also correct. The edge cases are also handled correctly. Therefore, the function is correct, but the expected outputs in the comments are incorrect for some cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/98,HumanEval/98,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment 'count' in Python is 'count += 1'.

However, the main issue is the syntax error, which prevents the function from executing properly."
exp_8_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where the fractional part is exactly 0.5, which is critical for rounding away from zero. The current implementation only checks if the fractional part is greater than 0.0 to determine the closest integer, which leads to incorrect results for values like '14.5' and '-15.5'. Instead, it should check if the fractional part is exactly 0.5 to round away from zero. Additionally, the check for negative numbers is not implemented correctly, as it does not account for rounding down in the negative direction when the fractional part is 0.5."

The logic used in the loop to append stones is flawed. For odd 'n', it should append the next odd number starting from 'n', and for even 'n', it should append the next even number starting from 'n'. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the stones for each level, leading to incorrect results for the test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/102,HumanEval/102,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains errors in the range definition for the loop. The use of 'maxOf(x, y)' and 'minOf(x, y)' is incorrect as these functions are not defined. Instead, the loop should iterate from 'max(x, y)' to 'min(x, y) - 1' (inclusive) in reverse order. Additionally, the logic for determining the range of numbers to check for even integers is flawed. The function should check the range inclusively, and the loop should be structured to correctly identify the largest even number within the specified range."

However, it uses 'd % 2 != 0' on 'd', which is a string character, leading to a TypeError. The correct approach should convert 'd' back to an integer before performing the modulus operation. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where a number might contain a zero, which is an even digit. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results for all test cases."
exp_8_HumanEval/105,HumanEval/105,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the requirement to ignore numbers outside the range of 1 to 9. Specifically, the sorting and reversing of the array should only include numbers between 1 and 9. The current implementation sorts and reverses the entire array, including negative numbers and numbers greater than 9, which leads to incorrect results. For example, in the case of the input [1, -1, 55], the function returns ['One'] instead of an empty array, as it should only consider valid numbers. The filtering should occur before sorting and reversing."
exp_8_HumanEval/106,HumanEval/106,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function f is incorrect because the sum of numbers from 1 to i is not calculated correctly for odd indices. The sum should be calculated as sum(range(1, i + 1)), but the expected output for odd indices is not matching the description. For example, for i=3, the expected output is 6 (which is the factorial of 3), but the implementation returns 6 for i=3, which is correct. However, the expected output for i=5 is 15, which is the sum of numbers from 1 to 5, but the implementation returns 120 (the factorial of 5). Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

Firstly, the use of 'count++' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'count += 1'. Secondly, the method 'toString()' does not exist for integers in Python; instead, 'str(num)' should be used to convert the number to a string. Additionally, the method 'digits()' is not a valid method for strings in Python; to iterate over the digits, one should simply loop through the string representation of the number. Furthermore, the logic for counting signed digits in negative numbers is flawed; it should consider the absolute value of the number when summing the digits. Lastly, the test cases provided in the 'check' function do not align with the expected behavior described in the comments, particularly regarding how negative numbers are handled."
exp_8_HumanEval/109,HumanEval/109,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'move_one_ball' does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by right shifts. The current logic checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not the requirement. The function should instead check for the number of 'breaks' in the order of the array. A valid array that can be sorted via right shifts will have at most one point where the order breaks (i.e., where an element is greater than the next). The current implementation fails to account for this and will incorrectly return True for arrays that cannot be sorted by right shifts."
exp_8_HumanEval/110,HumanEval/110,True,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where lst1 has odd numbers and lst2 has no even numbers available for exchange. The inner loop only breaks when an even number is found in lst2, but if lst2 has no even numbers, the outer loop continues to the next odd number in lst1 without returning 'NO'. This leads to incorrect results in cases where lst1 cannot be made entirely even. For example, the test case exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3]) should return 'NO' but the implementation would incorrectly return 'YES' because it does not check if all odd numbers in lst1 can be exchanged with even numbers in lst2."

Specifically, when the input string s is equal to the characters in c, the function returns an empty string, but it incorrectly evaluates this empty string as a palindrome (it should return False instead of True). For example, the test case check(candidate) with the input ('a', 'a') should return ('', False) instead of ('', True). This discrepancy indicates that the palindrome check is not correctly implemented."

Secondly, the sorting logic does not correctly account for the number of ones in the binary representation as specified in the function description. The expected output for the test cases does not match the actual output produced by the function, indicating that the sorting is not performed as required. For example, the expected output for 'sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], but the implementation does not produce this result."

Additionally, the logic to find the closest vowel is flawed; it incorrectly checks the vowel at word[i + 1] instead of looking for a vowel that is between two consonants. The test cases also reveal inconsistencies, such as 'full' returning 'u' instead of 'U', and 'Above' returning 'o' instead of 'A'. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the comments."

The test case 'prod_signs([0, 1])' should return 0, which is correct, but the test case 'prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])' should return -9, which is also correct, but the logic fails for other cases where the signs are mixed with zeros. The test case 'prod_signs([-1, 1, 1, 1])' should return -4, but it will return 0 due to the sign product being zero. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."

For example, in the case of 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed not part of any previous word, but the implementation incorrectly checks this by looking for 'e' in the concatenated string of previous words without spaces. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs, such as 'apple pi e' returning True, which is correct, but 'apple pi e ' returning False, which is also correct, but the logic is not sound for all cases. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string has trailing spaces correctly."

Additionally, the test case can_arrange([1,2,4,5]) should return -1, which is correctly handled, but the function fails to identify the correct index in other cases.

However, the test case 'largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7])' returns (None, 1), which is correct, but the test case 'largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7, 0])' also returns (None, 1), which is correct. The function is not handling the edge cases correctly, particularly when there are no positive integers present.

Specifically, when comparing '1' (as a string) and 1 (as an integer), the function converts '1' to a float, which is equal to 1, and thus returns None. However, the requirement states that if the values are equal, None should be returned only if they are of the same type. Since one is a string and the other is an integer, the function should return the larger value instead of None. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where both inputs are strings correctly if they contain commas, as it converts them to floats but does not check for equality in their original string forms."

The function should determine if n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. For example, 10 can be expressed as 2 + 2 + 2 + 4, but the current implementation would return False for 10. Therefore, the function fails to satisfy the test cases correctly."

The expected behavior is to replace all consecutive spaces with a single '-' only if there are more than 2 consecutive spaces, and to replace single spaces with '_'. The test cases provided also indicate that the function does not produce the expected outputs for several assertions, such as 'Mudasir Hanif ' and 'Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow'."

Firstly, the use of '++' for incrementing 'digits_count' is incorrect in Python; it should be 'digits_count += 1'. Secondly, the check for the substring before the dot should ensure that it starts with a letter and is not empty, but the current implementation incorrectly uses 'isalpha()' and 'isdigit()' together, which can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, 'isalpha()' should be used to check if the first character is a letter, and the length of the substring should be checked to ensure it is not empty. Additionally, the extension check does not account for the case where the extension is empty, which should also return 'No'. These issues lead to incorrect evaluations for some test cases."

This leads to incorrect results for test cases where the index is both a multiple of 3 and 4. For example, at index 0 (which is both), the function squares the value but does not cube it as it should. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate([-56,-99,1,0,-2]) == 3030' is expected to fail because the correct output should be calculated based on the rules provided in the function's description."

For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, so it should not be included in the output. However, the test case 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' expects an empty string, which is correct. The issue arises in the test case 'assert candidate(""there is no place available here"") == ""there is no place""', where 'there' (5), 'is' (2), 'no' (2), and 'place' (5) are all prime, but 'available' (9) is not, so the expected output should be 'there is no place' which is correct. However, the function does not handle all cases correctly, especially when the word lengths are not prime.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the order of planets when planet1 is after planet2 in the list; it should return the planets in the correct order regardless of the input order.

Firstly, the method 'filter' is incorrectly used; it should be 'filter' as a built-in function, not as a method on the list. Secondly, the sorting logic is flawed; it first sorts by length and then sorts alphabetically, which will not maintain the correct order since the second sort will override the first. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to filter out strings of odd lengths.

Additionally, the function incorrectly adds the square of zero, which should not contribute to the sum of squares of odd numbers. The test assertions also reveal that the function does not return the expected results for various cases, such as 'candidate([5, 4])' which should return 25 but does not match the expected behavior.

The test case 'compare([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])' expects the output to be [2,4,6], which is correct, but the implementation does not account for the absolute difference correctly when the guess is negative. The absolute difference should always be calculated as abs(game[i] - guess[i]), which is correctly implemented. However, the test case 'compare([1,2,3,5],[-1,2,3,4])' expects the output to be [2,0,0,1], but the implementation will return [2,0,0,1] which is correct. The issue arises from the fact that the test cases are not comprehensive enough to cover all edge cases, particularly with negative guesses. Therefore, the implementation is not fully validated against all possible scenarios."

Instead, 'num' should be integer-divided using 'num //= 10'. Lastly, the return statement uses 'Pair' which is not defined in the code; it should return a tuple directly using '(count_even, count_odd)'.

Additionally, the function only uses a list of pre-defined Roman numeral strings indexed by the integer value, which does not account for numbers that require combinations of different Roman numeral symbols (e.g., 251).

The correct implementation should first identify the longest side and then apply the Pythagorean theorem accordingly. For example, in the case of 'right_angle_triangle(10, 6, 8)', the function incorrectly returns True because it assumes 'c' is the hypotenuse without checking if '10' is the longest side."

However, the current implementation only iterates from 'a' to 'b' without reversing the range when 'a' is greater than 'b'. Therefore, the output for the test case 'generate_integers(10, 2)' is incorrect as it will return an empty list instead of [2, 4, 6, 8].

However, the implementation also incorrectly counts characters that are not letters (like spaces) as distinct, which is not specified in the function's description. The test case 'abcde' + 'cade' + 'CADE' is also misleading because it should return 5, but the implementation does not account for the fact that 'c', 'a', 'd', and 'e' are repeated in different cases.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the closest elements are equal, which is also required by the problem statement."
exp_9_HumanEval/21,HumanEval/21,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'rescale_to_unit' is correct for the provided test cases, except for the assertion 'assert candidate([100.0, 49.9]) == [1.0, 0.0]'. This assertion is incorrect because the function is designed to return a list where the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. For the input [100.0, 49.9], the expected output should be [1.0, 0.0] as per the assertion, but the function will return [1.0, 0.0] which is correct. However, the assertion is misleading as it implies that the order of the output should match the input order, which is not the case. Therefore, the test case is misleading and the function does not handle this case correctly."
exp_9_HumanEval/22,HumanEval/22,True,CORRECT,"The function 'filter_integers' correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension that checks the type of each value using 'isinstance(value, int)', which is the appropriate way to filter for integers in Python. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function also validate the correctness of the implementation, as they cover various cases, including empty lists and lists with mixed types. All assertions pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected."
exp_9_HumanEval/23,HumanEval/23,True,CORRECT,"The function 'strlen' correctly implements the logic to return the length of a given string using Python's built-in 'len' function. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function cover various cases, including an empty string and strings of different lengths, all of which are correctly handled by the 'strlen' function. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_9_HumanEval/24,HumanEval/24,False,INCORRECT,"The function largest_divisor is intended to find the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n. However, the implementation incorrectly returns n when the divisor is less than or equal to 1, which is not the expected behavior. For example, when n is 3, the function should return 1, but it returns 3 instead. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n is 1 correctly, as it would return 1 instead of indicating that there are no divisors smaller than 1. The test assertions also expect the function to return 1 for prime numbers, which is not handled correctly in the current implementation."
exp_9_HumanEval/25,HumanEval/25,False,INCORRECT,"The code contains a syntax error in the line 'i++', which is not valid in Python. The correct increment operation should be 'i += 1'. Additionally, the division operation 'n /= i' should be 'n //= i' to ensure that 'n' remains an integer during factorization. These issues will prevent the function from executing correctly and returning the expected results."
exp_9_HumanEval/26,HumanEval/26,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'remove_duplicates' does not correctly remove all elements that occur more than once. According to the provided docstring, the function should return a list of integers where any integer that appears more than once in the input list is completely removed. However, in the test case 'assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]', the expected output is [1, 4, 5], which is correct, but the implementation does not account for the fact that '2' and '3' should be removed entirely, not just the duplicates. The current implementation only filters out duplicates while keeping the first occurrence, which is incorrect based on the function's description."
exp_9_HumanEval/27,HumanEval/27,True,CORRECT,"The function 'flip_case' correctly implements the behavior described in the docstring. It flips the case of each alphabetic character in the input string while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. The provided test assertions confirm that the function works as intended for various cases, including an empty string and strings with punctuation."
exp_9_HumanEval/28,HumanEval/28,True,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'concatenate' function correctly concatenates a list of strings into a single string using the ''.join() method. The provided test assertions in the 'check' function validate the expected behavior of the function, including edge cases like an empty list and a list with multiple strings. All assertions pass, confirming that the function works as intended."
exp_9_HumanEval/29,HumanEval/29,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'filter_by_prefix' is correct in terms of filtering strings that start with the given prefix. However, the test case 'check(candidate)' fails because the expected output for the input ['xxx', 'asd', 'xxy', 'john doe', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] with prefix 'xxx' should be ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] but the actual output is ['xxx', 'xxxAAA', 'xxx'] which is correct. The issue lies in the assertion that checks the output against the expected result. The expected output in the assertion is incorrect, as it does not match the actual output of the function."
exp_9_HumanEval/30,HumanEval/30,True,CORRECT,"The function get_positive correctly implements the logic to return only positive numbers from the input list. The provided test assertions in the check function confirm that the implementation behaves as expected for various cases, including lists with negative numbers, mixed numbers, and empty lists. All assertions pass, indicating that the function is working correctly."
exp_9_HumanEval/31,HumanEval/31,False,CORRECT,"The implementation of the 'is_prime' function correctly identifies prime numbers based on the provided definition. It checks if a number is less than or equal to 1, returning False for such cases. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking for divisibility. If any divisor is found, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The test assertions cover various cases, including edge cases and larger prime numbers, and they all pass successfully, confirming the correctness of the implementation."
exp_9_HumanEval/32,HumanEval/32,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'find_zero' function is incorrect. The function assumes that the polynomial is always quadratic (degree 2) based on the calculation of the zero point using the formula -xs[n] / (2 * xs[n - 1]). This approach only works for quadratic polynomials, but the function is designed to handle polynomials of even degrees with more than two coefficients. Additionally, the test cases provided in the docstring do not cover all possible scenarios for polynomials of higher degrees, which could lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the function does not correctly find the zero of a polynomial with arbitrary even-degree coefficients."
exp_9_HumanEval/33,HumanEval/33,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `sort_third` does not correctly sort the values at indices that are divisible by three. The current implementation sorts only the sublists of three elements starting from each index divisible by three and assigns the middle value of the sorted sublist to the corresponding index. This does not fulfill the requirement of sorting all values at indices divisible by three across the entire list. For example, in the test case `sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])`, the expected output is `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`, but the function does not produce this result correctly. Instead, it only considers local groups of three elements, which leads to incorrect outputs for larger lists."
exp_9_HumanEval/34,HumanEval/34,True,CORRECT,"The function 'unique' correctly implements the logic to return sorted unique elements from a list. It first converts the list to a set to remove duplicates, then sorts the resulting set and returns it as a list. The provided test assertion checks the function with a specific input and verifies that the output matches the expected sorted unique elements. Since the output is as expected, the implementation is correct."
exp_9_HumanEval/35,HumanEval/35,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function max_element is correct, as it uses the built-in max function to return the maximum element in the list. However, the test assertions in the check function contain an error. The second assertion checks for the maximum of the list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 124, 1, -10], but it incorrectly expects the result to be 124 instead of the correct maximum value, which is 124. Therefore, the test case fails, indicating that the overall correctness of the implementation is compromised by the incorrect test case."
exp_9_HumanEval/36,HumanEval/36,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function contains a syntax error with the increment operation 'count++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for counting the occurrences of the digit '7' is correct, but the function will not run successfully due to this syntax error. Therefore, the function will not produce the expected results as described in the docstring and assertions."
exp_9_HumanEval/37,HumanEval/37,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the values at the even indices. The current implementation only replaces the even indexed values with the first element of the sorted list of even indexed values, rather than placing the sorted values back into their respective even indices. This results in incorrect outputs for the provided test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/38,HumanEval/38,False,INCORRECT,"The `check` function is incorrectly testing the `encode_cyclic` function instead of the `decode_cyclic` function. The assertion should be checking if `decode_cyclic(encoded_str)` returns the original string `str`, but it mistakenly checks `encode_cyclic(encoded_str)`. This will always fail because encoding an already encoded string does not yield the original string. Therefore, the implementation of the encoding and decoding functions is correct, but the test assertions are flawed."
exp_9_HumanEval/39,HumanEval/39,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_fib' is intended to return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. However, the implementation only checks the first n Fibonacci numbers and returns the first one that is prime, which is incorrect. For example, when n=6, the function will return 13 instead of the correct 233, as it only checks the first 6 Fibonacci numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). Additionally, the function does not correctly handle cases beyond the pre-defined list of Fibonacci numbers. The test cases indicate that the expected output for n=6 is 233, which is not returned by the current implementation."
exp_9_HumanEval/40,HumanEval/40,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'triples_sum_to_zero' is designed to check for three distinct elements that sum to zero. However, the second test case in the assertions, 'assert candidate([1, 3, 5, -1]) == False', is incorrect because the elements 1, 3, and -4 (which is not in the list) would not sum to zero. The function correctly returns False for this input. However, the test case does not include a valid combination that sums to zero, which is necessary for a comprehensive test. The function itself is logically correct, but the test cases provided do not fully validate its correctness, leading to a conclusion that the implementation is not thoroughly tested."
exp_9_HumanEval/41,HumanEval/41,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function car_race_collision contains a syntax error with the use of '++' for incrementing the collisions variable, which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for counting collisions is flawed. The number of collisions should be calculated as n * n, since each car from the left set collides with each car from the right set, resulting in n^2 collisions. The test assertions expect the output to be n^2, but the current implementation does not correctly compute this value."
exp_9_HumanEval/42,HumanEval/42,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'incr_list' is correctly implemented to increment each element of the list by 1. However, the test assertions in the 'check' function contain an error. The assertion 'assert candidate([3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2]' is incorrect because the expected output should be [4, 3, 2] instead of [4, 3, 2]. The expected output is correct, but the assertion is incorrectly stated as it does not match the expected output of the function. Therefore, the overall correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed due to the flawed test case."
exp_9_HumanEval/43,HumanEval/43,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function pairs_sum_to_zero is incorrect because it does not properly check for distinct pairs that sum to zero. The inner loop iterates through the entire list again, including elements that have already been added to the 'seen' set, which leads to incorrect behavior. For example, if the list contains both -1 and 1, the function may not find them as distinct pairs due to the way it manages the 'seen' set. A correct approach would involve checking if the negative of the current element exists in the set of seen elements without adding the same element twice."
exp_9_HumanEval/44,HumanEval/44,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'change_base' is intended to convert a number 'x' from base 10 to a specified base (less than 10), but it incorrectly uses 'format(int(x, base), 'x')', which is not appropriate for converting from base 10 to another base. Instead, it should implement a conversion algorithm that repeatedly divides the number by the base and collects the remainders. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that are not valid for the intended functionality, such as 'candidate(9, 3) == ""100""', which is incorrect since 9 in base 3 is not '100'. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the function description."

The expected values for fib4(5), fib4(6), fib4(7), etc., do not match the values produced by the function. Specifically, the test assertions provided in the check function expect fib4(8) to return 28 and fib4(10) to return 104, which are not consistent with the expected sequence based on the defined rules. The initial sequence values and the recurrence relation are not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results."
exp_9_HumanEval/47,HumanEval/47,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the median function is mostly correct, but there is an error in the expected output for the second test case in the check function. The median of the list [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20] should be 10.0 (the average of 6 and 10), not 8.0 as asserted in the test. Therefore, the test assertions do not match the expected behavior of the median function."
exp_9_HumanEval/48,HumanEval/48,True,CORRECT,"The function 'is_palindrome' correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse. The provided test assertions cover various cases, including empty strings, palindromic strings, and non-palindromic strings, all of which return the expected results. Therefore, the implementation is correct."
exp_9_HumanEval/49,HumanEval/49,True,INCORRECT,"The function modp(n, p) is intended to return 2^n modulo p. However, the implementation uses the expression '2 ** n % p', which is correct for calculating the result. The issue arises from the test cases provided in the check function. The test cases for modp(30, 5) and modp(31, 5) are not part of the original function's description and are not included in the docstring examples. Specifically, modp(30, 5) should return 4 (as 2^30 % 5 = 4) and modp(31, 5) should return 3 (as 2^31 % 5 = 3). Since these additional assertions are not validated in the original function's docstring, it indicates that the function may not be handling all edge cases correctly or that the additional test cases are not properly justified. Therefore, the overall evaluation is that the implementation is incorrect due to the lack of clarity and completeness in the test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/50,HumanEval/50,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode_shift' and 'decode_shift' functions is incorrect. The 'encode_shift' function shifts characters by 5 positions in the alphabet, but it does not handle characters that are not lowercase letters (e.g., uppercase letters, digits, or punctuation). Additionally, the 'decode_shift' function attempts to decode the string using the same logic but incorrectly applies the shift. The modulo operation is also incorrectly applied, leading to incorrect character encoding and decoding. The test assertions in the 'check' function will fail because the 'decode_shift' function is not being tested; instead, 'encode_shift' is being checked against itself, which is not the intended behavior."
exp_9_HumanEval/51,HumanEval/51,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'remove_vowels' does not correctly handle the removal of vowels. Specifically, it only adds characters to the result if they are alphabetic and not in the set of vowels. However, it fails to account for non-alphabetic characters, which should be included in the output. For example, the test case 'abcdef' should return 'bcdf', which is correct, but the test case 'acBAA' should return 'cB', which is correct, but the test case 'EcBOO' should return 'cB', which is also correct. However, the test case 'fedcba' should return 'fdcb', but it does not match the expected output in the test assertions. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."

For example, 'eabcdzzzz' and 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' both contain the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'z', so they should return True, but the current implementation returns False because the counts differ. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's docstring."

The correct syntax for incrementing a variable in Python is 'open_brackets += 1'. This will cause the function to raise a SyntaxError when executed. Additionally, the logic of the function appears to be correct for checking balanced brackets, but the syntax error prevents it from functioning as intended."
exp_9_HumanEval/57,HumanEval/57,True,INCORRECT,"The function 'monotonic' is intended to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. However, the implementation incorrectly uses 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=) in the checks. This means that it will return True for lists that have equal consecutive elements, which is not aligned with the typical definition of monotonicity. For example, the list [4, 1, 1, 0] should return False because it is not strictly decreasing. The test case assertions also indicate that the function should return True for lists with equal elements, which is not consistent with the expected behavior of a monotonic function."
exp_9_HumanEval/58,HumanEval/58,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly identifies the common elements between two lists, removes duplicates by converting the lists to sets, and then returns a sorted list of these common elements.

Additionally, the logic for finding the largest prime factor is flawed. The function should return the largest prime factor after reducing 'n' to 1, but it currently returns 'n' directly, which may not be a prime factor. The test cases in the 'check' function also include values that are not guaranteed to be non-prime, which contradicts the function's assumption."

The correct results should be candidate(6) == 21 (which is correct) and candidate(11) == 66 (which is also correct). Therefore, the test assertions do not match the expected results for all cases, leading to an overall incorrect evaluation."

Specifically, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be 'open_brackets += 1'. Additionally, the 'else if' statement should be replaced with 'elif', and the braces '{ }' should be replaced with indentation, as Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. These syntax errors will prevent the function from executing correctly, leading to incorrect results."
exp_9_HumanEval/62,HumanEval/62,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the derivative function only returns the coefficients of the polynomial without calculating the actual derivative. The derivative of a polynomial is computed by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and reducing the power by one.

The test cases provided in the check function indicate that the expected outputs for fibfib(2), fibfib(5), fibfib(8), and others are correct, but the implementation fails to return the correct values for n < 3. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect."
exp_9_HumanEval/64,HumanEval/64,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'vowels_count' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. It should be 'count += 1'. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle uppercase vowels, as it only checks for lowercase vowels.

According to the function's description, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed. However, the implementation only reverses the digits when the shift is equal to or greater than the length of the digits. The test case 'assert candidate(100, 2) == ""001""' fails because the expected output is '001', but the function will return '100' instead, as it does not reverse the digits when the shift is equal to the number of digits. Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(11, 101) == ""11""' is also problematic since the expected behavior is to reverse the digits, which would yield '11' but does not demonstrate the intended functionality of the shift.

Specifically, the logic to update 'smallest_index' when encountering an even number equal to 'smallest_even' is incorrect. The current implementation only updates 'smallest_index' if the current index 'i' is less than the existing 'smallest_index', which is unnecessary since we are already tracking the smallest even number. This results in incorrect outputs for cases where the smallest even number appears multiple times. For example, in the test case 'assert candidate([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) == [0, 1]', the function should return [0, 1] as expected, but it may fail for other similar cases."

Additionally, the function does not account for the possibility of multiple integers meeting the criteria, and it only returns the maximum found, which may not be the correct answer if there are integers with the same frequency but lower values.

The function is supposed to return a list sorted in a 'strange order' (minimum, maximum, minimum, maximum, etc.), but the final line of the function simply returns the sorted list using 'lst.sorted()', which does not implement the required alternating min-max logic. Additionally, the function does not handle cases with negative integers correctly, as indicated in the notes. Therefore, the assertions in the 'check' function will fail for cases that require the strange sorting order."

The current implementation only checks if the list is equal to its reverse, but it does not handle cases where the list might be empty or contain non-integer elements. Additionally, the function should return False for an empty list, which is correctly implemented, but it fails to account for the requirement that the list must be a palindrome before checking the sum against the weight limit. The test cases also include an edge case where the function should return False for [1, 2, 3] with a weight of 6, which is correctly handled, but the overall logic for determining if the object will fly is flawed."

exp_9_HumanEval/77,HumanEval/77,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'iscube' is incorrect because it uses the expression 'a ** (1.0 / 3.0) % 1 == 0' to determine if 'a' is a perfect cube. This approach can lead to inaccuracies due to floating-point precision issues. For example, while it may correctly identify some cubes, it can fail for others, especially larger numbers or negative numbers. A more reliable method would be to compute the integer cube root and then check if cubing that result returns the original number."
exp_9_HumanEval/78,HumanEval/78,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'hex_key' contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which should be 'count += 1' in Python. Additionally, the string '2357ABED' does not correctly represent the prime hexadecimal digits according to the problem statement. The correct prime hexadecimal digits are '2357BD', where 'B' corresponds to decimal 11 and 'D' corresponds to decimal 13. The function will not return the expected results for the provided test cases due to these issues."
exp_9_HumanEval/79,HumanEval/79,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'decimal_to_binary' does not correctly handle the conversion of decimal numbers to binary format. Specifically, it adds padding to the binary representation to ensure it is always 8 bits long, which is not specified in the function's description. For example, the binary representation of 15 is '1111', but the function returns 'db00001111db', which is incorrect. The expected output for decimal_to_binary(15) should be 'db1111db', but the function adds unnecessary leading zeros. Additionally, the test case for decimal 103 is not included in the expected output, which could lead to further discrepancies."
exp_9_HumanEval/80,HumanEval/80,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_happy' does not correctly check for the condition that every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct. The current logic checks for distinct groups of 3 letters but does not ensure that every set of 3 consecutive letters in the string is distinct from the next set of 3. For example, in the string 'iopaxioi', the function would incorrectly return True because it only checks the first few groups and does not validate all consecutive groups of 3 letters. The correct approach should involve checking each triplet of characters in the string to ensure they are distinct from the next triplet."

Specifically, the condition for the GPA of 3.0 should return 'B+' for values greater than 3.0, but the implementation returns 'B+' for values equal to 3.0. Additionally, the condition for GPA of 2.0 should return 'C+' for values greater than 2.0, but the implementation returns 'C+' for values equal to 2.0. This leads to incorrect letter grades for certain GPA values, as shown in the test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/82,HumanEval/82,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'prime_length' is expected to return True if the length of the input string is a prime number. However, the implementation lacks the definition of the 'is_prime' function, which is crucial for determining if a number is prime. Without this function, the code will raise a NameError when executed. Additionally, the test cases include assertions that may not align with the correct prime number lengths, such as 'HI' (length 2, which is prime) returning True, but 'M' (length 1, which is not prime) returning False. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect."

Additionally, the logic for counting n-digit integers is flawed. The range should start from 10**(n-1) to 10**n to ensure only n-digit numbers are considered. The current implementation counts all numbers from 0 to 10^n, which includes numbers with fewer than n digits. Therefore, the function will not return the correct counts for the provided test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/84,HumanEval/84,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'solve' is intended to return the sum of the digits of the binary representation of the input integer N, converted back to binary. However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the sum of the binary digits. For example, for N = 150, the binary representation is '10010110', and the sum of its digits is 5 (1+0+0+1+0+1+1+0), not 6 as stated in the comment. Therefore, the expected output for N = 150 should be '101' (binary of 5), not '110'. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_9_HumanEval/85,HumanEval/85,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'add' is supposed to sum the even elements that are at odd indices in the list. However, the implementation simply sums all elements at odd indices without checking if they are even. For example, in the case of 'add([4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122])', the function would return 5 + 7 = 12 instead of just summing the even numbers at odd indices, which should be 122. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirement."
exp_9_HumanEval/86,HumanEval/86,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'anti_shuffle' does not preserve the spaces between words in the output.

exp_9_HumanEval/87,HumanEval/87,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly sort the coordinates as specified in the problem statement. The sorting logic combines two separate sorting operations into one return statement, which results in incorrect ordering. The coordinates should first be sorted by rows in ascending order, and then for each row, the coordinates should be sorted by columns in descending order. The current implementation does not achieve this and instead concatenates two sorted lists, which leads to an incorrect final output."
exp_9_HumanEval/88,HumanEval/88,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sort_array' incorrectly calculates the sum of the first and last index values. Instead of using the values at those indices, it uses their indices (0 and len(array) - 1). This leads to incorrect behavior when determining whether to sort in ascending or descending order. For example, in the case of the array [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the sum of the first and last index is 0 + 6 = 6 (even), but the function is incorrectly using the indices, which results in sorting in descending order instead of the expected ascending order."

The function currently shifts letters by two places instead of four. For example, `encrypt('hi')` should return 'lm' (correct), but `encrypt('faewfawefaewg')` returns 'jeiajeaijeiak' which is incorrect; it should return 'jeiajeaijeaik'. The test cases provided in the `check` function reveal that the output does not match the expected results for several assertions, indicating that the logic for shifting letters is flawed."
exp_9_HumanEval/90,HumanEval/90,False,INCORRECT,"The function next_smallest() does not correctly identify the second smallest element in all cases. Specifically, it fails when there are duplicate smallest elements. For example, in the case of next_smallest([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), the expected output is None since there is no second distinct smallest element, but the function incorrectly returns 1. Additionally, the logic for updating second_smallest does not account for the scenario where the smallest element is repeated, leading to incorrect results."
exp_9_HumanEval/91,HumanEval/91,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'is_bored' contains a syntax error with the increment operator '++', which is not valid in Python. Additionally, the logic for counting sentences that start with 'I' is flawed because it only checks for sentences split by '.', and does not account for sentences ending with '?' or '!', which should also be considered as separate sentences. The condition to check if a sentence starts with 'I' is also incorrectly applied since the split does not handle the other delimiters. Therefore, the function will not produce the correct results as per the requirements."
exp_9_HumanEval/92,HumanEval/92,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'any_int' has several issues. Firstly, it uses 'true' and 'false' instead of 'True' and 'False', which will cause a NameError. Secondly, the condition to check if all numbers are integers is incorrectly placed; it should be checked before evaluating the sum condition. The function should first verify that all inputs are integers before checking if one number equals the sum of the other two. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the inputs are not integers correctly, leading to potential incorrect outputs."
exp_9_HumanEval/93,HumanEval/93,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'encode' function does not correctly replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. Instead of replacing the vowel, it appends a character from the original message based on the index, which leads to incorrect results. For example, for the input 'This is a message', the vowel 'i' should be replaced with 'k', but the implementation incorrectly adds characters from the original message instead. Additionally, the case swapping is not consistent with the expected output, as the output should be in the opposite case of the input. The test assertions also indicate that the function does not produce the expected results."
exp_9_HumanEval/94,HumanEval/94,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify the largest prime number in the list. The function assumes that the largest prime is always greater than 0, but it fails to handle cases where there are no prime numbers in the list.

In the test case check_dict_case({'p':'pineapple', 5:'banana', 'a':'apple'}), the key '5' is an integer, which should cause the function to return False. However, the implementation does not check the type of the keys before calling islower() or isupper(), which leads to a TypeError when trying to call these methods on a non-string key. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the comments."
exp_9_HumanEval/96,HumanEval/96,True,INCORRECT,"The function count_up_to is intended to return an array of the first n prime numbers that are less than n. However, the implementation incorrectly returns all prime numbers less than n, rather than limiting the output to the first n primes. For example, count_up_to(6) should return [2, 3, 5] but the function will return [2, 3, 5]. The test case for count_up_to(7) is also incorrect as it should return [2, 3, 5] but the implementation will return the same result. The function does not account for the requirement of returning only the first n primes, leading to incorrect outputs for inputs greater than 5."

For example, 'multiply(19, 28)' should return 72 (9 * 8), which is correct, but 'multiply(148, 412)' should return 32 (8 * 2), not 16. Additionally, 'multiply(14, -15)' should return 20 (4 * 5), which is correct, but the overall logic of the function does not match the expected results for all test cases. The assertion for 'multiply(76, 67)' should return 42 (6 * 7), which is also correct. Therefore, the implementation does not consistently produce the expected outputs as described in the comments."

exp_9_HumanEval/99,HumanEval/99,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function closest_integer does not correctly handle the case when the fractional part is exactly 0.5 or -0.5. Specifically, the logic used to determine the closest integer only rounds up for positive fractional parts and does not account for rounding away from zero for negative values. For example, closest_integer('-15.5') should return -16, but the current implementation will return -15 due to the incorrect handling of the fractional part. Additionally, the check function has a duplicate assertion label 'Test 3' which could lead to confusion."
exp_9_HumanEval/100,HumanEval/100,False,INCORRECT,"The function implementation is incorrect because it uses undefined functions 'even_number()' and 'odd_number()' to generate the next even and odd numbers.

The function uses 'maxOf(x, y)' and 'minOf(x, y)', which are not defined in the provided code. Instead, it should use 'max(x, y)' and 'min(x, y)'. Additionally, the range function is incorrectly set up; it should include the endpoints, which means the loop should iterate from 'max(x, y)' down to 'min(x, y) - 1' to ensure it checks all numbers in the inclusive range. This will lead to incorrect results for certain inputs."

Firstly, the method 'Integer.toBinaryString' is not valid in Python; it seems to be a reference from Java. In Python, the correct way to convert an integer to a binary string is using 'bin()'. Secondly, the rounding of the average is not correctly implemented; the average should be rounded to the nearest integer using the built-in 'round()' function in Python. Lastly, the test assertions include cases that are not correctly handled by the current implementation, such as the average calculation and binary conversion. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

However, it does this incorrectly by applying the modulo operation to the string characters instead of converting them back to integers. This will lead to a TypeError since string characters cannot be used with the modulo operator directly. Therefore, the function will not work as intended and will fail on any input that contains numbers with even digits."
exp_9_HumanEval/105,HumanEval/105,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'by_length' does not correctly replace the integers with their corresponding names. The function currently converts the integers to strings instead of mapping them to their names. For example, the number 2 is converted to '2' instead of 'Two'. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers or numbers greater than 9 correctly, as it should ignore them entirely, but it currently includes them in the sorted and reversed array before filtering. This leads to incorrect results for the provided test cases."

The sum should be calculated as sum(range(1, i + 1)), which is correct, but the factorial calculation for even indices is incorrect. The factorial of i should be calculated for i starting from 0 (0! = 1) and not from 1. Therefore, the expected output for even indices is off by one. For example, f(5) should return [1, 2, 6, 24, 15], but the factorial for 2 (which is 2) and for 4 (which is 24) are correct, while the sum for 1 (which is 1) and for 3 (which is 6) are also correct. However, the output for f(7) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect factorial for 6.

Specifically, the code increments `times` for every '1' in the grid, but it also incorrectly increments `times` again when the bucket is full (i.e., when `times % bucket_capacity == 0`). This leads to an overcounting of the number of times buckets are lowered. For example, in the first test case, the expected output is 6, but the implementation may produce a different result due to this logic error. Additionally, the code uses `grid.shape`, which is not applicable for a list of lists in Python; it should use `len(grid)` for rows and `len(grid[0])` for columns.

Additionally, the condition to find consonants is flawed because it checks the character at i + 1 instead of looking for a vowel between two consonants. The function should return the vowel at index i when it finds two consonants at indices i-1 and i. Furthermore, the test case assertions are inconsistent with the expected behavior of the function, particularly with the case sensitivity and the definition of 'closest vowel'. For example, 'FULL' should return 'U' but the implementation returns 'u' due to the conversion to uppercase. Overall, the logic does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the comments."

However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the length as 'end - start + 1', which results in a length of 2 for the intersection (1, 2) and (2, 3). This leads to incorrect results for some test cases, such as candidate((1, 2), (2, 3)) returning 'YES' instead of 'NO'.

Additionally, the test case prod_signs([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1]) is expected to return -10, but the logic for calculating the signs and magnitudes does not align with the expected output. The function needs to handle the case of zero correctly and ensure that the product of signs reflects the presence of any zeros."
exp_9_HumanEval/129,HumanEval/129,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `minPath` contains several issues. Firstly, the logic for tracking the path and ensuring the minimum path is lexicographically ordered is not correctly implemented. The variable `step` is incremented incorrectly with `step++`, which is not valid in Python; it should be `step += 1`. Additionally, the way the path values are assigned to `minPath` is flawed, as it does not correctly capture the values of the cells traversed in the path. The assertions in the `check` function also indicate that the expected outputs do not match the actual outputs produced by the function, suggesting that the logic for determining the minimum path is not functioning as intended."
exp_9_HumanEval/130,HumanEval/130,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'tri' function does not correctly compute the Tribonacci sequence as described in the comments. Specifically, the base cases and the recurrence relations are not correctly defined. For instance, 'tri(1)' should return 3, but the function returns 1. Additionally, the handling of odd and even cases is incorrect, leading to incorrect results in the test assertions. The expected outputs in the assertions do not match the outputs produced by the function, indicating that the logic is flawed."
exp_9_HumanEval/131,HumanEval/131,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the 'digits' function contains a logical error. The variable 'odd_digits' is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the product of the odd digits. However, multiplying by 0 will always result in 0, which means that the product will never be correctly calculated. Instead, 'odd_digits' should be initialized to 1 to correctly compute the product of the odd digits. Additionally, there is no handling for the case where there are no odd digits, which should return 0. The test cases provided in the 'check' function will fail due to this issue."
exp_9_HumanEval/132,HumanEval/132,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function is_nested does not correctly identify nested brackets. The logic used to determine if a bracket is nested is flawed. The variable 'nested' is set to True when encountering an opening bracket '[' and reset to False when encountering a closing bracket ']'. This means that it only checks for consecutive opening brackets without properly validating the nesting structure. For example, in the input '[[]]', the function would return True, which is correct, but it would also incorrectly return True for inputs like '[[[[]]]]' and '[][][[]]', which are valid, but it fails to handle cases like '[]' and '[][]' correctly. The test cases also indicate that the function fails to return the expected results for certain inputs, such as '[]', which should return False but is not handled correctly in the implementation."
exp_9_HumanEval/133,HumanEval/133,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' contains several issues. Firstly, the method 'map' is not a built-in function for lists in Python; it should be used with 'map()' function or list comprehensions. Secondly, 'math.ceil' is correctly used, but the rounding and squaring operations are not properly implemented. The code attempts to use 'Int', which is not defined in Python. Additionally, the final return statement should sum the squared values correctly, but the current implementation does not follow Python syntax. Therefore, the function will raise errors and not produce the expected results."
exp_9_HumanEval/134,HumanEval/134,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly determine if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character that is not part of a word. Specifically, the condition checking if the last character is not part of the previous words is flawed. For example, in the input 'apple pi e', the last character 'e' is indeed not part of any other word, so it should return True, which it does. However, in the case of 'apple pi e ', the function incorrectly identifies that the last character is ' ' (space) and thus does not check the last valid character 'e'. The implementation fails to handle trailing spaces correctly, leading to incorrect results for inputs with trailing spaces. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string is a single character correctly, as it does not check if the string is empty before accessing the last character."
exp_9_HumanEval/135,HumanEval/135,True,INCORRECT,"The function can_arrange is supposed to return the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. However, the test case assert candidate([1,2,4,5])==-1 is incorrect because the function should return 3 for this input, as 4 is not greater than 5. Additionally, the test case assert candidate([1,4,2,5,6,7,8,9,10])==2 is also incorrect because the function should return 1, as 4 is not greater than 2. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the function description."
exp_9_HumanEval/136,HumanEval/136,True,CORRECT,"The function correctly identifies the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer from the input list. It handles cases with no negative or positive integers by returning None for those values, as specified in the function's description. The provided test assertions cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases, and all assertions pass successfully, confirming the implementation's correctness."
exp_9_HumanEval/137,HumanEval/137,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly handle the case where one of the inputs is a string representation of a number with a comma (e.g., '2,3'). The function replaces commas with periods for both inputs, but it does not convert the string to a float before comparing. This can lead to incorrect comparisons when one input is a float and the other is a string with a comma. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where both inputs are strings with commas correctly, as it only attempts to convert them to floats if both are strings. The test cases also do not cover all possible scenarios, such as comparing a float with a string that represents a number with a comma. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements outlined in the function's description."
exp_9_HumanEval/138,HumanEval/138,False,INCORRECT,"The function is_equal_to_sum_even is incorrectly implemented. It only checks if n is equal to 8 (since sum(4 * [2]) evaluates to 8), which does not account for other valid sums of four positive even numbers. For example, 10 (2 + 2 + 2 + 4) and 12 (2 + 2 + 4 + 4) can also be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers, but the current implementation would return False for these cases. Therefore, the function does not correctly evaluate whether n can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers."
exp_9_HumanEval/139,HumanEval/139,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'special_factorial' only calculates the factorial of 'n' (n!) and does not compute the Brazilian factorial as described in the comments. The Brazilian factorial requires the product of all factorials from n down to 1 (n! * (n-1)! * ... * 1!). The current implementation will not yield the correct results for the provided test cases, as it does not account for the factorials of numbers less than 'n'. For example, special_factorial(4) should return 288, but the current implementation returns 24 (which is 4!)."
exp_9_HumanEval/140,HumanEval/140,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'fix_spaces' does not correctly handle the replacement of spaces as described in the comments. Specifically, the regex substitution does not differentiate between single spaces and multiple consecutive spaces correctly. For instance, the test case 'Mudasir Hanif ' should return 'Mudasir_Hanif_' but it will return 'Mudasir_Hanif_' as expected, however, the case with multiple spaces like 'Exa   mple' should return 'Exa-mple' but it will return 'Exa-mple' as expected. The issue arises in the handling of leading spaces and the fact that the function does not ensure that all consecutive spaces are replaced with a single '-' when there are more than two consecutive spaces. The test case '   Exa 1 2 2 mple' should return '-Exa_1_2_2_mple' but it will return '-Exa_1_2_2_mple' as expected. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as specified in the docstring."
exp_9_HumanEval/141,HumanEval/141,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function `file_name_check` has several issues that prevent it from correctly validating file names according to the specified criteria. Firstly, the check for the starting character of the file name is incorrect; it uses `file_name.startswith(string.ascii_letters)`, which is not valid as `startswith` expects a string or tuple of strings, not a sequence of characters. Additionally, the condition `if not file_name.startswith(string.ascii_letters) or not file_name[1].isalpha():` incorrectly checks the second character instead of ensuring that the first character is a letter. Furthermore, the function does not correctly handle cases where there are more than three digits, as it does not check the total number of digits after the loop. Lastly, the function does not account for the possibility of multiple dots or invalid extensions properly. Therefore, the function fails to return the expected results for several test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/142,HumanEval/142,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sum_squares' does not correctly apply the squaring and cubing logic based on the index conditions. Specifically, it squares the value at an index that is a multiple of 3, but it also incorrectly cubes the value at an index that is a multiple of 4 without checking if it is not a multiple of 3. The conditions for cubing are not mutually exclusive from squaring, which leads to incorrect results. For example, for the input [-56,-99,1,0,-2], the expected output is 3030, but the function will not produce this due to the flawed logic in index handling."
exp_9_HumanEval/143,HumanEval/143,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not correctly identify words whose lengths are prime numbers. For example, the word 'here' has a length of 4, which is not prime, so it should not be included in the output. However, the assertion 'assert candidate(""here"") == """"' expects an empty string, which is correct, but the function does not handle cases correctly where multiple words are involved. The output for 'there is no place available here' should be 'there is no place', but it incorrectly includes 'available' which has a length of 9 (not prime). Additionally, the function lacks the implementation of the 'is_prime' function, which is necessary for the prime check."

The comparison 'x_value * n_value == int(x_value * n_value)' will not work as intended due to floating-point precision issues. Instead, the function should check if the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators results in a whole number by using integer arithmetic. Specifically, it should check if (x_numerator * n_numerator) % (x_denominator * n_denominator) == 0 to determine if the result is a whole number."
exp_9_HumanEval/145,HumanEval/145,False,INCORRECT,"The function 'order_by_points' is intended to sort a list of integers based on the sum of their digits in ascending order. However, the sorting is done using 'reverse=True', which sorts the list in descending order instead. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of multiple integers with the same digit sum correctly, as it does not maintain their original order based on their indices. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specified requirements."
exp_9_HumanEval/146,HumanEval/146,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'specialFilter' contains a syntax error in the line 'count++', which is not valid in Python. The correct way to increment 'count' in Python is 'count += 1'. Additionally, the logic for checking the first and last digits is flawed. The last digit is correctly checked using 'num % 10', but the first digit should be checked by converting the number to a string or using integer division. The current implementation does not correctly handle negative numbers, as it does not account for the absolute value when checking digits. Therefore, the function will not return the expected results for the provided test cases."
exp_9_HumanEval/147,HumanEval/147,False,INCORRECT,"The code has a logical error in the condition that checks if the sum of the triples is a multiple of 3.

Additionally, the increment operator '++' is not valid in Python; it should be 'count += 1'. These issues will lead to incorrect results."
exp_9_HumanEval/148,HumanEval/148,False,INCORRECT,"The function does not handle the case where the two planets are the same correctly. According to the description, if planet1 and planet2 are the same, the function should return an empty tuple. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition and will return an empty tuple only if one of the planets is not valid. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the planets are provided in reverse order correctly; it should return the planets in the order of their proximity to the sun regardless of the input order. The test case 'assert candidate(""Earth"", ""Earth"") == ()' is expected to pass, but it will not due to the lack of this check."
exp_9_HumanEval/149,HumanEval/149,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'sorted_list_sum' contains syntax errors and logical flaws. Firstly, the method 'filter' is not a valid method for lists in Python; it should use a list comprehension or the built-in 'filter' function. Secondly, the sorting logic is incorrect; the function attempts to sort the list twice, which will not yield the desired order. The correct approach should involve filtering out odd-length strings, then sorting the remaining strings first by length and then alphabetically. Additionally, the assumption that 'all words will have the same length' contradicts the requirement to sort by length. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the function's specifications."

Additionally, the test cases include an assertion for 'n = 1', which is not a prime number, but the function does not handle this case correctly as per the definition of prime numbers. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect."
exp_9_HumanEval/151,HumanEval/151,True,INCORRECT,"The function double_the_difference has a logical error in the condition that checks for negative numbers and non-integers. The condition 'not num % 1 == 0' is intended to check if the number is an integer, but it is incorrectly implemented. The correct way to check if a number is an integer is to use 'not isinstance(num, int)'. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains positive odd integers, as it adds 0 for even numbers instead of ignoring them. The test cases provided also indicate that the function does not return the expected results for certain inputs, such as candidate([5, 4]) which should return 25 but does not due to the incorrect implementation."
exp_9_HumanEval/152,HumanEval/152,True,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function 'compare' is mostly correct, but it fails to handle negative guesses properly. For example, in the test case 'compare([1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3])', the expected output is [2,4,6] because the absolute differences should be calculated as follows: |1 - (-1)| = 2, |2 - (-2)| = 4, |3 - (-3)| = 6. However, the function does not account for the fact that guesses can be negative, which leads to incorrect results in this case. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the requirements as specified in the function description."
exp_9_HumanEval/153,HumanEval/153,False,INCORRECT,"The implementation of the function does not correctly handle the case where two extensions have the same strength. The code compares the extensions using the '<' operator, which compares them lexicographically. However, the requirement states that if two extensions have the same strength, the one that comes first in the list should be chosen. This means that the current implementation may incorrectly select an extension that appears later in the list if it is lexicographically smaller, rather than the one that appears first. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the extensions contain non-alphabetic characters correctly, as the strength calculation assumes only letters are present."

However, the current implementation only checks if the second word or its reverse is in the first word, which does not account for all possible rotations. For example, 'cycpattern_check(""efef"",""fee"")' should return True because 'fee' is a rotation of 'efef', but the current implementation will return False. Additionally, the test cases in the 'check' function include scenarios that are not correctly handled by the current implementation, leading to incorrect results."

Second, the division operator '/' should be replaced with integer division '//' to correctly reduce the number by one digit. Lastly, the return statement uses 'Pair', which is not defined in Python; it should return a tuple instead, like '(count_even, count_odd)'. These issues will lead to syntax errors and incorrect results."

As a result, the function will fail to return the correct Roman numeral for many numbers, such as 1, 4, 9, 40, 90, 400, and 900.

For example, in the test case find_max(['abc', 'cba']), both words have 3 unique characters, but 'abc' should be returned as it comes first lexicographically. The current implementation would return 'cba' instead. Additionally, the test case find_max(['aaaaaaa', 'bb', 'cc']) is incorrectly expected to return 'aaaaaaa' when it should return 'bb' or 'cc' since they have more unique characters. Therefore, the function does not meet the specified requirements."

It should return [total, remaining - need] instead. Additionally, when there are not enough remaining carrots, the function should return [number + remaining, 0], which is correct, but the logic for the first case is flawed.

However, the current implementation evaluates it strictly from left to right, resulting in a different outcome. The correct evaluation should respect the mathematical precedence of operators, where exponentiation has the highest precedence, followed by multiplication, and then addition.

Additionally, the test case 'assert candidate(132, 2) == [2, 4, 6, 8]' is also incorrect as it does not reflect the range properly. The function needs to be modified to handle cases where 'a' is greater than 'b' by reversing the range or ensuring the inputs are always in ascending order."
